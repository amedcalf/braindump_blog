For instance the latest advice from the Prison Service Pay Review Body and Senior Salaries Review Body¬†were <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/pay-review-bodies\">only partially accepted</a>. The Government has the final say so could alter the parameters if it wanted to.</p>\n<p>But perhaps more problematic is that the government can exert a lot of influence over what the advice is going to be in the first place, to a level I wasn&rsquo;t really aware of until recently.</p>\n<p>For a start it&rsquo;s the government who appoints each of the board members in the first place, with the Prime Minister being responsible for appointing the chair. But we don&rsquo;t need to get into the realms of the personal to see how constrained the boards are.</p>\n<p>Each year the relevant government minister sends a remit to the board concerned, alongside their the pay changes the government already decided it wants to make.  The remit tells the board which factors they should focus on when making their decisions alongside any constraints that the government <em>has already decided to enforce</em> that they must bear in mind.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the constraints are such that they exclude many of decisions the board in theory could make.</p>\n<p>For instance, between 2013 and 2017 the public sector pay growth was limited to an average of 1%. The constraint was imposed by the government, not the pay review board. In situations like these the boards can only give advice on <em>how</em> to distribute that 1%.</p>\n<p>Likewise during 2021-2022 there was a general public sector pay freeze ordered by the government for most public sector employees. The pay review boards could then only give advice on how to implement rises for types of workers the government had decided were eligible.</p>\n<p>This year the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-pay-review-body-remit-letter-2023-to-2024/nhs-pay-review-body-remit-letter-2023-to-2024-pay-round\">NHS remit letter</a> tells the board that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;the NHS budget has already been set until 2024 to 2025. Pay awards must strike a careful balance ‚Äì recognising the vital importance of public sector workers while delivering value for the taxpayer, considering private sector pay levels, not increasing the country‚Äôs debt further, and being careful not to drive prices even higher in the future.</p>\n<p>In the current economic context, it is particularly important that you also have regard to the government‚Äôs inflation target when forming recommendations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the board is constrained to giving advice that if enacted wouldn&rsquo;t increase the amount of budget the NHS would need to fulfill it. They&rsquo;d also probably want to avoid using up enough of the pre-decided budget such that another aspect of the investment-starved service would suffer even more than it already is. The latter is something that can easily happen - there are many reports of, for example, the pressure schools are under to give their staff pay rises the government agreed to, but with the government failing to actually providing the extra budget needed to enact the raise. Thus some other critical part of the educational experience in this case must suffer.</p>\n<p>The NHS remit letter this year also tells the board to ensure that their advice somehow focuses on the inflation target that the government set, rather than, say, what&rsquo;s necessary for a happy, efficient, effective workforce.</p>\n<p>This feels entirely backwards to me, and sometimes potentially impossible. How does one take the government&rsquo;s inflation target into consideration at the same time as considering private sector pay levels,  when the private sector is not constrained to take any note at all of the government&rsquo;s inflation target in making its pay awards?</p>\n<p>Naively, I had expected that the pay review board created its recommendations based on the need to recruit, retain and engage employees in the domain that they&rsquo;re responsible for. They&rsquo;d ensure that the employees have enough income to live a reasonable life, and ideally have pay roughly comparable to other similar job opportunities out there. Except of course if we&rsquo;re  particularly desperate to recruit and retain some roles (which we are - we&rsquo;re desperate for nurses and teachers amongst others), in which case perhaps the pay or conditions would have to be improved to reflect that.</p>\n<p>In this fantasy world, the board&rsquo;s recommendations would then give input to the government to help them to figure out what budget they need to provide in order to fulfill the pay recommendations, in addition to any other investments or costs the service in question needs outside of the domain of the Pay Review Board. But in reality it looks to be more the other way around. The government can pre-set the budget and enforce constraints of its own choosing. The boards seem to be more advising on how to implement the government&rsquo;s existing plans rather than enabled to provide an independent opinion as to what those plans should be in the first place.</p>\n",

Pay awards must strike a careful balance ‚Äì recognising the vital importance of public sector workers while delivering value for the taxpayer, considering private sector pay levels, not increasing the country‚Äôs debt further, and being careful not to drive prices even higher in the future.\r\n> \r\n> In the current economic context, it is particularly important that you also have regard to the government‚Äôs inflation target when forming recommendations.\r\n\r\nThus the board is constrained to giving advice that if enacted wouldn't increase the amount of budget the NHS would need to fulfill it. They'd also probably want to avoid using up enough of the pre-decided budget such that another aspect of the investment-starved service would suffer even more than it already is. The latter is something that can easily happen - there are many reports of, for example, the pressure schools are under to give their staff pay rises the government agreed to, but with the government failing to actually providing the extra budget needed to enact the raise. Thus some other critical part of the educational experience in this case must suffer. \r\n\r\nThe NHS remit letter this year also tells the board to ensure that their advice somehow focuses on the inflation target that the government set, rather than, say, what's necessary for a happy, efficient, effective workforce.\r\n\r\nThis feels entirely backwards to me, and sometimes potentially impossible. How does one take the government's inflation target into consideration at the same time as considering private sector pay levels,  when the private sector is not constrained to take any note at all of the government's inflation target in making its pay awards?\r\n\r\nNaively, I had expected that the pay review board created its recommendations based on the need to recruit, retain and engage employees in the domain that they're responsible for. They'd ensure that the employees have enough income to live a reasonable life, and ideally have pay roughly comparable to other similar job opportunities out there. Except of course if we're  particularly desperate to recruit and retain some roles (which we are - we're desperate for nurses and teachers amongst others), in which case perhaps the pay or conditions would have to be improved to reflect that. \r\n\r\nIn this fantasy world, the board's recommendations would then give input to the government to help them to figure out what budget they need to provide in order to fulfill the pay recommendations, in addition to any other investments or costs the service in question needs outside of the domain of the Pay Review Board. But in reality it looks to be more the other way around. The government can pre-set the budget and enforce constraints of its own choosing. The boards seem to be more advising on how to implement the government's existing plans rather than enabled to provide an independent opinion as to what those plans should be in the first place.\r\n\r\n",

				"title": "Mental illness as \"a sane response to an insane world\"",
				"content_html": "<p>One idea that has been circling around my head a lot recently is how we commonly treat the recent &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; of mental illness as something specifically pertaining to the individual sufferers concerned. We&rsquo;re often inclined, however compassionately, to attributing their suffering to their personal &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; biology, their brain chemistry or their thinking patterns. We don&rsquo;t step back and look at the potentially larger scale social and political causes of it.</p>\n<p>In the book <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781785924798?title=Life+Isn%27t+Binary&amp;author=Alex+Iantaffi&amp;cover_id=32801\">Life Isn&rsquo;t Binary</a>, Barker and Iantaffi provide a phrasing of this issue that has stuck with me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps we would do well to view the depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles that most of us grapple with at some point as a sane response to an insane world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The pain and struggles are entirely real, there&rsquo;s no questioning of that. But in many cases they&rsquo;re also understandable without recourse to individual &ldquo;abnormalities&rdquo;. They have causes; logical, rational and predictable antecedents.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes they may in fact be the result of the body and brain working perfectly normally given the situation they find themselves in. In <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781632868312?title=Lost+Connections&amp;author=Johann+Hari&amp;cover_id=32781\">Lost Connections</a>, Hari notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve evolved responses to dangers that may not be &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for today&rsquo;s challenges in many cases. But the fact that people have those responses is necessarily not a sign of bad or unusual health. They&rsquo;re a perfectly normal response to situations that are perceived to pose some kind of threat.</p>\n<p>In some instances the threats may not be real but rather the result of some misunderstanding. In these cases perhaps a valid avenue of treatment might be to try and help someone change how they think about a situation. But on other occasions times the perceived threat may in fact be very real.</p>\n<p>As is obvious from the above, this kind of issue has been touched upon to some extent by several books and articles I&rsquo;ve read in recent times. But it&rsquo;s not clear to me that it&rsquo;s reached the point of full acceptance, or that the conclusions that logically follow from this train of thinking have been concretely transformed into policy, perhaps outside of a few trials.</p>\n<p>This is not necessarily through the very real historical lack of compassion and understanding that has confronted those afflicted with mental health issues. In fact, some of the resistance to this idea might be the concern that taking this view too far to the extremes could result in the ignoring of people&rsquo;s very individual needs, or a failure to provide the individual-level treatments are in fact needed in some cases.</p>\n<p>A quote I saw somewhere taken from a psychotherapist called D. W. Winnicott&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Human Nature&rsquo;, which runs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The capacity to become depressed&hellip;is something that is not inborn nor is it an illness; it comes as an achievement of healthy emotional growth&hellip;the fact is that life itself is difficult. Probably the greatest suffering in the human world is the suffering of normal or healthy or mature persons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that at least the first part of that must be true. No-one that I&rsquo;m aware of thinks that their own life is entirely easy, uncomplicated and stress-free. But it&rsquo;s often hard for us to viscerally remember that fact when it comes to understanding and interacting with other people. This is especially the case if we feel like someone mistreated us, that they&rsquo;re of &ldquo;bad character&rdquo; (whatever that means) or that they&rsquo;re somehow getting a better deal out of life than us. Even at the extremes, is there really any reason to believe that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is presently living a happy and care-free life  (actually maybe he&rsquo;s only <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html\">second richest</a> now)?</p>\n<p>If we accept that most, possibly all, people feel that their life is in some way a struggle then wouldn&rsquo;t we find it strange if they <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> ever have any kind of negative psychological response? That might feel like a disorder in itself.</p>\n<p>Perhaps part of the controversy from the compassionate side might be a fear that, in understanding that it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to have the capacity to suffer from what we now classify as mental illness one, could misguidedly come to the conclusion that, hey, we just need to live with it. Sure you&rsquo;re suffering, maybe a lot more than most people -  but it&rsquo;s a perfect normal phenomenon. You don&rsquo;t need treatment. There&rsquo;s nothing we should or even could do about it. That would be entirely the wrong conclusion to draw.</p>\n<p>But very little of import in this discussion is the result of a unmodifiable natural law. Societies have changed over time.</p>\n<p>By many metrics they tend to improve in many ways - this famously being a core thesis of books like Pinker&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780141034645\">The Better Angels of our Nature</a>&rdquo; as well as his more recent work. It does seem to me that it&rsquo;s very often a fallacy to think &ldquo;things must have been better in every way a few decades ago&rdquo; or &ldquo;if we lived a life more like someone in the past would have then we&rsquo;d be guaranteed happiness&rdquo;.   But even if the direction <em>has</em> generally been positive in the past, then there&rsquo;s no guarantee it always will be. Besides, there will always be hiccups, mis-steps and temporary deviations into potential despair along the way.</p>\n<p>But the fact that there have been changes in the past show us that there can be changes in the future. I often wonder what people 200 years from now will look back on us and think &ldquo;oh man, that&rsquo;s wild that they used to do that. How could they possibly believe <em>that</em> was OK?&rdquo; about in the same way that we might look back on people from past centuries, wondering how they could ever believe what they needed to believe in order behave in ways that by today&rsquo;s standards we would consider illogical, foolish, and cruel.</p>\n<p>But another bad conclusion one can draw, this time from <em>not</em> taking social or other macro causes of mental distress into account, comes from the idea that those who get diagnosed as depressed, anxious and so on are the unhappy victims of random bad brain chemistry or invalid patters of thought. This idea might lead people to infer that the individual medicalisation of patients is a necessary <em>and sufficient</em> manner of addressing their pain.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely not against the use of pharmaceuticals or other individual-level medical therapies of any helpful kind. Sometimes their usage may be imperative, urgent, and life saving. But in the cases where there is a plausible social or environmental cause for the condition - let&rsquo;s say abject loneliness, poverty-induced fear and exhaustion, anxiety resulting from racial abuse, the legacy of past traumas, all those kind of things - giving someone individual medical &ldquo;brain treatment&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do anything about removing the cause. The same cause that likely wrecks the life of many other people in addition to the one who summoned up the strength to visit a doctor and had the access to do so.</p>\n<p>Most damningly, limiting ourselves to individually medicalising the sufferers of a structural effect lets us off the hook from even addressing the causes. Often this is convenient, in the sense that truly addressing some structural or social determinants of disease may involve solutions that are politically challenging to even discuss in the current environment, let alone carry out.</p>\n<p>As just one example of what we know could be done, at one point in the Covid-19 pandemic the UK made a concerted and effective effort to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; homelessness. Being without accommodation is a life situation which is <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/ending-homelessness/health-and-wellbeing/mental-health/\">highly associated</a> with the suffering of mental health disorders, both as cause and effect. But with this initiative, street homelessness <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/mar/opinion-five-lessons-pandemic-taught-us-about-ending-homelessness-permanently\">was apparently almost eliminated </a>and tens of thousands of people were moved from emergency to longer term accommodation.</p>\n<p>It seems like in general the policy worked! However the Government chose to <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318\">end the scheme</a>. Last year a quarter of the beneficiaries of the scheme are <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/1_in_4_people_helped_off_the_streets_under_the_governments_everyone_in_scheme_are_no_longer_being_accommodated_\">back to having no accommodation</a> It&rsquo;s feared that the 2022 cost of living crisis will cause a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis\">tidal wave</a>&rdquo; of new homelessness, and given the <a href=\"https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society\">acknowledged connection</a> between homelessness and mental illness, an unnecessary spike in mental suffering.</p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html\">New York Times opinion article</a> provided the following metaphor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You‚Äôre going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If something about some people&rsquo;s lives today is causing them mental anguish, then we certainly need to treat that suffering. But a solution that doesn&rsquo;t also stop the metaphorical guy who is mowing down their well-being is never going to be sustainable, complete or robust.</p>\n<p>Therapising someone who&rsquo;s anxiety is exacerbated by for instance food insecurity, who knows that the only way they can afford to eat even low-quality unhealthful food is dependent on them keeping their low-paid, precarious and abusive job, may potentially help their inner state in the short term. But it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to remove the actual, real, threat of them in truth  not being able live without exposing themselves to abusive conditions - conditions that they don&rsquo;t have any agency over;  however unpleasant the job is, it might taken away from them at someone else&rsquo;s whim. Someone who didn&rsquo;t respond to those prospects with a substantial level of at least worry and trepidation would seem unusual to me.</p>\n<p>If their response is damaging to their own quality of life then they surely must be individually helped. But we must also address whatever has led us to a place where their ability to lead a fulfilling life depends on your luck and ability to take employment at any personal cost. What led us to a place where more than 1 in 5 millennials <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness\">feel like they have no friends</a>? A society where financial security depends in part <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">upon your race</a>? That those who live in some areas <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492\">die many years earlier</a> than those that live elsewhere, even in a small and rich country? A land where the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on you <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/22/those-with-the-least-have-suffered-the-most-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">were more severe if you were already poorer beforehand</a>?</p>\n<p>This becomes even clearer to me when we look at patterns of mental health issues. These sorts of statistics are always a little hard to interpret because to feature in such a dataset often requires you to have had access to and attended certain types of healthcare. It may even depend the specific medical practitioner you see when you do so.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780143127741?title=The+Body+Keeps+the+Score&amp;author=Bessel+A.+Van+der+Kolk&amp;cover_id=32791\">The Body Keeps The Score,</a> the author writes that despite the best attempts of psychiatrists to define and categorise mental illnesses, for example in the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM), specific diagnoses often come down to tallying up a list of symptoms and may depend as much on the mindset of the doctor concerned as on the patient. The fact that new editions of the DSM categorisation come out every so often with new and altered definitions reinforces the point that we haven&rsquo;t fully solved how to categorise mental illness, let alone treat it.</p>\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942\">All Our Relations</a>, Tanya Talaga draws a direct line between the incredibly high rate of that most extreme outcome of adverse mental health, suicide, and the social conditions that the Indigenous peoples of countries like Canada and the US find now themselves in.</p>\n<p>She reports that in Canada, suicide and self-harm is now the leading cause of death of First Nations people up to the age of 44. Rates are more than 5 times higher than a comparison group of non-Indigenous people for males aged between 15-24.</p>\n<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t always the case. The suicide epidemic in those communities is a modern phenomenon, seen only after the introduction of forced resettlement and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system\">Indian Residential schools</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The natural brain biochemistry of these folk didn&rsquo;t suddenly change overnight. No genetic mutation suddenly somehow retrospectively swept their culture. Rather, their way of life, their beliefs, their freedoms, hopes and dreams had been assaulted by the political decisions and resulting social conditions at the time.</p>\n<p>Today Indigenous children are more likely to grow up without access to the basic determinants of health, which Talaga lists as including income, status, clean water and air, decent accommodation, supportive families and communities, education, healthcare and a connection to their traditions. The absence of these basics negatively affects their physical, mental and social health.</p>\n<p>A related critique of the &ldquo;DSM-5&rdquo; type categorisation approach to mental illness was made by the British Psychological society in <a href=\"https://dxrevisionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsm-5-2011-bps-response.pdf\">their response</a> to the development of the that system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;systems such as this are based on identifying problems as located within individuals.\nThis misses the relational context of problems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In all this I want to remember that it&rsquo;s very likely that some mental illness does have a biochemical, brain or genetic basis that might be directly treatable in more conventional ways. Few people seem to argue against the idea that pharmaceuticals in this sphere do have their uses. They may be necessary even when the underlying cause of an issue isn&rsquo;t due to unusual brain chemistry. But cannot be the be-all and end-all of interventions when the cause of the condition being treated lies outside of the person.</p>\n<p>Furthermore,  it may bring comfort to those with particular suffering to have a medicalised label. If nothing else it provides a valuable recognition that those around them can acknowledge, understand and treat. Perhaps a sense that your pain is real, and can be addressed. It may be reassuring in some sense to feel biologically unlucky as opposed to blameworthy. But of course issue there is more about the invalid and illogical misuse of blame concepts.</p>\n<p>A categorisation also provides a potential identity that allows them to seek out a peer group of those who face similar battles. This might be beneficial either in terms of learning strategies to tackle the issue directly, or by providing a social group of people with a common interest who you know understand rather than stigmatise you.</p>\n<p>Despite my general skepticism about the benefits of social networks, this does seem like one possible use of these technologies, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116909/\">especially for rarer conditions</a>. In 2016, Naslund et al. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/future-of-mental-health-care-peertopeer-support-and-social-media/DC0FB362B67DF2A48D42D487ED07C783\">wrote</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A potential downside I can imagine may be risk of the person ending up feeling like &ldquo;they are their illness&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s a fixed and permanent trait as opposed to something that can often be addressed. It may also be damaging if the idea that those outside the peer group can&rsquo;t help, and perhaps are even not to be trusted is cultivated. But overall, these types of peer groups are likely invaluable - &ldquo;given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks&rdquo;, to quote the Naslund paper.</p>\n<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t get the sense that this way of thinking is particularly routine in healthcare today, there have been a few interventions that do seem to acknowledge the social, political and environmental causes and exacerbations of mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Recently the results of a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/\">National Health Service</a> intervention that involved the prescribing of heating <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63707689\">reported success</a>. &ldquo;Prescribing heating&rdquo; simply means paying the home heating bills for patients who cannot afford to do so themselves. This is an increasing number given the<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119567595/households-across-the-u-k-are-about-experience-an-80-jump-in-energy-costs\"> dramatic increase in energy costs</a> in recent times.</p>\n<p>Many illnesses and other reductions in quality of life are caused or exacerbated by living in cold environs.  It&rsquo;s estimated that 10,000 people a year die of cold home related issues. Dealing with the other health consequences of cold homes costs the NHS ¬£860 million a year. Most of the reporting on this trial addresses physical illnesses, such as respiratory or circulatory conditions, rather than mental illnesses, but <a href=\"https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf\">the report that calculated the ¬£860 million figure</a> does note that living in cold or otherwise inadequate homes can also have a severe impact on mental health.</p>\n<p>In 2018 we saw a &ldquo;social prescribing&rdquo; initiative that would enable doctors <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/\">to prescribe therapeutic art or hobby based treatments</a> for instance. Related trials so far have shown improvements in patients physical and mental health. This approach is one potential plank of the Government&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936725/6.4882_DCMS_Loneliness_Strategy_web_Update_V2.pdf\">anti-loneliness strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>The NHS notes that social prescribing is effective for a <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/\">wide range of people</a>, including those who need support with their mental health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists agrees, <a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/social-prescribing\">reporting</a>) that social prescribing helps people connect to their community in a way that can improve their health, both physical and mental.</p>\n<p>Of course, as with almost anything, there&rsquo;s a risk of taking this idea too far. We must avoid people being &ldquo;socially-prescribed&rdquo; to on the basis that it&rsquo;s a simpler or cheaper option than the alternatives (if it is - I don&rsquo;t know).</p>\n<p>It will not be a suitable solution for everyone. The Royal College of Psychiatrists notes that it, in isolation, social prescribing will only likely be sufficient treatment <a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/position-statements/position-statement-ps01-21---social-prescribing---2021.pdf\">for patients with mild mental illnesses</a>. For moderate or severe conditions, more traditional forms of therapy and medication are still usually to be recommended, with social prescribing being considered as an accompaniment if suitable. Social prescribing might potentially also play a role in the prevention of these conditions originating in the first place.</p>\n<p>Social prescribing is of course only one intervention that addresses the idea that the way we live is causing many mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Many, perhaps most, future interventions may take place outside of the healthcare system. This is particularly the case if we continue to imagine healthcare as being something that you access when you&rsquo;re already ill rather than a service that helps lessens the likelihood of the illness in the first pace.</p>\n<p>One example currently outside of the domain of the UK healthcare system - although the line often seems somewhat arbitrary to me - are food banks. Food banks exist to directly address the problem of people going hungry by giving free food parcels to people who are in such a state of destitution that they cannot otherwise obtain food. In the UK these are typically run by charities or NGOs, such the <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/\">Trussell Trust,</a> who have stepped up where the state has dramatically and unnecessarily failed its citizenry.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/dd06f2f2-bea9-46ff-941c-1d8849dce077/Mental%20Health%20Report%20-%20Final%200303.pdf\">a report</a> by mental health social worker Tom Pollard, the increasing demand for food banks is driven simply by an increasing number people not having enough income to buy food.  This phenomena is growing dramatically, driven by conscious, visible, political choices such as cuts to social security support, insecure employment practices and rising house costs.  43% of households on Universal Credit benefits experienced food insecurity in 2019-2020.</p>\n<p>Intuitively this seems a solvable problem. As the report says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not right that people need to rely on charity handouts to get by. Our social security system, at both a local and national level, and our economy, should ensure that everyone is able to afford food and other basics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the mean time, the struggle to not starve, the lack of personal agency, the feeling of failure and the cognitive effort required to  jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to access these services can come at a great cost to mental health. And all this to typically receive a one-off package containing up to 3 days worth of food - enough to not starve to death right now, but it surely can&rsquo;t do a lot for the person&rsquo;s ongoing peace of mind and ability to live a fulfilling life.</p>\n<p>In the words of the Big Issue&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/heartbreaking-reports-from-food-bank-users-show-mental-health-impact-of-poverty/\">writeup of the report</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soaring UK poverty forcing people to use food banks is creating a &lsquo;toxic environment&rsquo; for their mental health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/very-high-numbers-of-foodbank-users-have-mental-health-problems-and-disabilities-report\">A third</a> of households relying on these services include someone with mental health problems.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the use of foodbanks is stigmatised by some, with potential users reporting feelings of shame, anxiety and embarrassment at the thought of even visiting such an establishment. The film &ldquo;<a href=\"https://trakt.tv/movies/i-daniel-blake-2016\">I, Daniel Blake</a>&rdquo; portrays this kind of situation, and many of the other life-crushing effects of poverty in an effective and harrowing way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/foodbank-users-volunteers-reveal-shame-19155607\">There are certainly people</a> who don&rsquo;t seek even this most meagre assistance due to the shame they feel. The same goes for welfare benefits in general, as the recipients of those too are routinely shamed and abused by our elected officials, the media and the public at large.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/73738/benefits-stigma-means-10bn-goes-unclaimed\">polling</a> showed that most claimants feel shame sometimes, most or all of the time, with one in four potential claimants deferring or declining to apply for the assistance they are absolutely entitled to for this reason. Analysis suggested that a ball-park figure of ¬£10-15 billion per year in benefits went unclaimed in 2016. For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is roughly 5-8x the estimate for the value of benefit fraud during the same period, if I read <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664827/fraud-and-error-stats-release-2016-17-final-estimates.pdf\">the Government report</a> correctly.</p>\n<p>As it stands, <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/universal-credit-mental-health/\">one study</a> found an association between how many people are claiming benefits in an area and the amount of prescriptions for anti-depressants. For every 1% increase in people in a Local Authority area claiming Universal Credit there was a 5.6% increase in anti-depressants.</p>\n<p>With all these type of associative studies, the direction of causality is usually not clear. Does having mental health problems make you more likely to need to claim benefits? Or does the experience of claiming benefits and the limits of the life you can live on them lead to mental health problems? My assumption is that both are true to some extent, although I haven&rsquo;t looked much into work in this area.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://covidrealities.org/\">Covid Realities project</a> did however find instances of people describing the latter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;parents and carers living on a low-income reported experiences of stress, anxiety and low mood associated with claiming Universal Credit, connected to financial insecurity and the overall inadequacy of payments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In any case, there is clearly a set of people that both have distressing mental health conditions and live in poverty. Solving the latter is a moral imperative in its own right, and the direction of evidence would suggest that doing so would likely &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; improve the former.</p>\n<p>For those that are able to claim Universal Credit, the Government increased the amount of some entitlements by ¬£20 in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. This was presumably intended to assist with the increased financial pressure on those that already received benefits, and also those that the pandemic would end up forcing into the position of requiring them. After a year of Covid-19 raging the number of Universal Credit claimants had nearly doubled, up to 6 million recipients.</p>\n<p>This ¬£20 boost was well-received by anti-poverty campaigners.  However in October 2021, despite the pandemic very much still being with us and inflation making the cost of living ever more unbearable for the non-wealthy, the Government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58812609\">chose to abolish</a> even that ¬£20 increase.</p>\n<p>Many experts and campaign groups pleaded with them to not go ahead with that cut, including <a href=\"https://mentalhealth-uk.org/\">Mental Health UK</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-cut-sees-catastrophic-21695217\">highlighted the dangerous loop effect</a> between mental health and poverty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is not just a financial issue; we‚Äôre very concerned these pressures will result in more people seeing their mental health problems spiral, in turn making it difficult to manage their money worries and sending them deeper into the red.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/\">British Psychological Society</a> had similar concerns:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This decision will see health inequalities widen, placing more pressure on our already stretched and underfunded public services, as well as intensifying the mental health difficulties of people already struggling with rising debts, reduced income and soaring living costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Government went ahead with the cut, forcing people&rsquo;s lives into trajectories likely to cause or exacerbate mental illness. This was a political choice to knowingly create an environment that endangered mental health. Sure, some of the fallout symptomology might be treatable with medication (which comes with its own costs, financial and otherwise). But the suffering may never have occurred in the first place had we not consciously changed our societal environment in such a way.</p>\n<p>There are clearly numerous other ways we might think about enabling poorer people access to money, unhoused people to accommodation, lonely people to socialisation, hungry people to food, exploited workers to quality jobs, people who suffer prejudice to equity, people with disabilities to a full and happy life and so on. Many of these might be much more creative and affirming than simply providing food and income enough to live a tolerable life to those who need it - although doing that might well be a good, necessary and urgent first step given the dire situation we currently find ourselves in.</p>\n<p>But however we choose to address the subject, whilst taking care not to remove or reduce access to conventional medical therapies to those that need them, putting the foundations in place to solve the structural issues that in part cause the need in the first place is surely the sane response to an insane state of affairs.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "One idea that has been circling around my head a lot recently is how we commonly treat the recent \"epidemic\" of mental illness as something specifically pertaining to the individual sufferers concerned. We're often inclined, however compassionately, to attributing their suffering to their personal \"problematic\" biology, their brain chemistry or their thinking patterns. We don't step back and look at the potentially larger scale social and political causes of it. \r\n\r\nIn the book [Life Isn't Binary](https://micro.blog/books/9781785924798?title=Life+Isn%27t+Binary&author=Alex+Iantaffi&cover_id=32801), Barker and Iantaffi provide a phrasing of this issue that has stuck with me:\r\n\r\n>Perhaps we would do well to view the depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles that most of us grapple with at some point as a sane response to an insane world.\r\n\r\nThe pain and struggles are entirely real, there's no questioning of that. But in many cases they're also understandable without recourse to individual \"abnormalities\". They have causes; logical, rational and predictable antecedents.\r\n\r\nOftentimes they may in fact be the result of the body and brain working perfectly normally given the situation they find themselves in. In [Lost Connections](https://micro.blog/books/9781632868312?title=Lost+Connections&author=Johann+Hari&cover_id=32781), Hari notes:\r\n\r\n> It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.\r\n\r\nWe've evolved responses to dangers that may not be \"useful\" for today's challenges in many cases. But the fact that people have those responses is necessarily not a sign of bad or unusual health. They're a perfectly normal response to situations that are perceived to pose some kind of threat. \r\n\r\nIn some instances the threats may not be real but rather the result of some misunderstanding. In these cases perhaps a valid avenue of treatment might be to try and help someone change how they think about a situation. But on other occasions times the perceived threat may in fact be very real.                                                              \r\n\r\nAs is obvious from the above, this kind of issue has been touched upon to some extent by several books and articles I've read in recent times. But it's not clear to me that it's reached the point of full acceptance, or that the conclusions that logically follow from this train of thinking have been concretely transformed into policy, perhaps outside of a few trials. \r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily through the very real historical lack of compassion and understanding that has confronted those afflicted with mental health issues. In fact, some of the resistance to this idea might be the concern that taking this view too far to the extremes could result in the ignoring of people's very individual needs, or a failure to provide the individual-level treatments are in fact needed in some cases.\r\n\r\nA quote I saw somewhere taken from a psychotherapist called D. W. Winnicott's book 'Human Nature', which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n>The capacity to become depressed...is something that is not inborn nor is it an illness; it comes as an achievement of healthy emotional growth...the fact is that life itself is difficult. Probably the greatest suffering in the human world is the suffering of normal or healthy or mature persons.\r\n\r\nI think that at least the first part of that must be true. No-one that I'm aware of thinks that their own life is entirely easy, uncomplicated and stress-free. But it's often hard for us to viscerally remember that fact when it comes to understanding and interacting with other people. This is especially the case if we feel like someone mistreated us, that they're of \"bad character\" (whatever that means) or that they're somehow getting a better deal out of life than us. Even at the extremes, is there really any reason to believe that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is presently living a happy and care-free life  (actually maybe he's only [second richest](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html) now)? \r\n\r\nIf we accept that most, possibly all, people feel that their life is in some way a struggle then wouldn't we find it strange if they *didn't* ever have any kind of negative psychological response? That might feel like a disorder in itself. \r\n\r\nPerhaps part of the controversy from the compassionate side might be a fear that, in understanding that it's perfectly normal to have the capacity to suffer from what we now classify as mental illness one, could misguidedly come to the conclusion that, hey, we just need to live with it. Sure you're suffering, maybe a lot more than most people -  but it's a perfect normal phenomenon. You don't need treatment. There's nothing we should or even could do about it. That would be entirely the wrong conclusion to draw. \r\n\r\nBut very little of import in this discussion is the result of a unmodifiable natural law. Societies have changed over time.\r\n\r\nBy many metrics they tend to improve in many ways - this famously being a core thesis of books like Pinker's \"[The Better Angels of our Nature](https://micro.blog/books/9780141034645)\" as well as his more recent work. It does seem to me that it's very often a fallacy to think \"things must have been better in every way a few decades ago\" or \"if we lived a life more like someone in the past would have then we'd be guaranteed happiness\".   But even if the direction *has* generally been positive in the past, then there's no guarantee it always will be. Besides, there will always be hiccups, mis-steps and temporary deviations into potential despair along the way. \r\n\r\nBut the fact that there have been changes in the past show us that there can be changes in the future. I often wonder what people 200 years from now will look back on us and think \"oh man, that's wild that they used to do that. How could they possibly believe *that* was OK?\" about in the same way that we might look back on people from past centuries, wondering how they could ever believe what they needed to believe in order behave in ways that by today's standards we would consider illogical, foolish, and cruel.\r\n\r\nBut another bad conclusion one can draw, this time from *not* taking social or other macro causes of mental distress into account, comes from the idea that those who get diagnosed as depressed, anxious and so on are the unhappy victims of random bad brain chemistry or invalid patters of thought. This idea might lead people to infer that the individual medicalisation of patients is a necessary *and sufficient* manner of addressing their pain. \r\n\r\nI'm absolutely not against the use of pharmaceuticals or other individual-level medical therapies of any helpful kind. Sometimes their usage may be imperative, urgent, and life saving. But in the cases where there is a plausible social or environmental cause for the condition - let's say abject loneliness, poverty-induced fear and exhaustion, anxiety resulting from racial abuse, the legacy of past traumas, all those kind of things - giving someone individual medical \"brain treatment\" doesn't do anything about removing the cause. The same cause that likely wrecks the life of many other people in addition to the one who summoned up the strength to visit a doctor and had the access to do so. \r\n\r\nMost damningly, limiting ourselves to individually medicalising the sufferers of a structural effect lets us off the hook from even addressing the causes. Often this is convenient, in the sense that truly addressing some structural or social determinants of disease may involve solutions that are politically challenging to even discuss in the current environment, let alone carry out. \r\n\r\nAs just one example of what we know could be done, at one point in the Covid-19 pandemic the UK made a concerted and effective effort to \"solve\" homelessness. Being without accommodation is a life situation which is [highly associated](https://www.crisis.org.uk/ending-homelessness/health-and-wellbeing/mental-health/) with the suffering of mental health disorders, both as cause and effect. But with this initiative, street homelessness [was apparently almost eliminated ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/mar/opinion-five-lessons-pandemic-taught-us-about-ending-homelessness-permanently)and tens of thousands of people were moved from emergency to longer term accommodation. \r\n\r\nIt seems like in general the policy worked! However the Government chose to [end the scheme](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318). Last year a quarter of the beneficiaries of the scheme are [back to having no accommodation](https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/1_in_4_people_helped_off_the_streets_under_the_governments_everyone_in_scheme_are_no_longer_being_accommodated_) It's feared that the 2022 cost of living crisis will cause a \"[tidal wave](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis)\" of new homelessness, and given the [acknowledged connection](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society) between homelessness and mental illness, an unnecessary spike in mental suffering.\r\n\r\nA recent [New York Times opinion article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html) provided the following metaphor:\r\n\r\n> If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You‚Äôre going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.\r\n\r\nIf something about some people's lives today is causing them mental anguish, then we certainly need to treat that suffering. But a solution that doesn't also stop the metaphorical guy who is mowing down their well-being is never going to be sustainable, complete or robust.\r\n\r\nTherapising someone who's anxiety is exacerbated by for instance food insecurity, who knows that the only way they can afford to eat even low-quality unhealthful food is dependent on them keeping their low-paid, precarious and abusive job, may potentially help their inner state in the short term. But it doesn't do anything to remove the actual, real, threat of them in truth  not being able live without exposing themselves to abusive conditions - conditions that they don't have any agency over;  however unpleasant the job is, it might taken away from them at someone else's whim. Someone who didn't respond to those prospects with a substantial level of at least worry and trepidation would seem unusual to me. \r\n\r\nIf their response is damaging to their own quality of life then they surely must be individually helped. But we must also address whatever has led us to a place where their ability to lead a fulfilling life depends on your luck and ability to take employment at any personal cost. What led us to a place where more than 1 in 5 millennials [feel like they have no friends](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness)? A society where financial security depends in part [upon your race](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/)? That those who live in some areas [die many years earlier](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492) than those that live elsewhere, even in a small and rich country? A land where the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on you [were more severe if you were already poorer beforehand](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/22/those-with-the-least-have-suffered-the-most-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/)?\r\n\r\nThis becomes even clearer to me when we look at patterns of mental health issues. These sorts of statistics are always a little hard to interpret because to feature in such a dataset often requires you to have had access to and attended certain types of healthcare. It may even depend the specific medical practitioner you see when you do so. \r\n\r\nIn [The Body Keeps The Score,](https://micro.blog/books/9780143127741?title=The+Body+Keeps+the+Score&author=Bessel+A.+Van+der+Kolk&cover_id=32791) the author writes that despite the best attempts of psychiatrists to define and categorise mental illnesses, for example in the famous [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) (DSM), specific diagnoses often come down to tallying up a list of symptoms and may depend as much on the mindset of the doctor concerned as on the patient. The fact that new editions of the DSM categorisation come out every so often with new and altered definitions reinforces the point that we haven't fully solved how to categorise mental illness, let alone treat it.\r\n\r\nIn her book, [All Our Relations](https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942), Tanya Talaga draws a direct line between the incredibly high rate of that most extreme outcome of adverse mental health, suicide, and the social conditions that the Indigenous peoples of countries like Canada and the US find now themselves in. \r\n\r\nShe reports that in Canada, suicide and self-harm is now the leading cause of death of First Nations people up to the age of 44. Rates are more than 5 times higher than a comparison group of non-Indigenous people for males aged between 15-24. \r\n\r\nBut this wasn't always the case. The suicide epidemic in those communities is a modern phenomenon, seen only after the introduction of forced resettlement and the \"[Indian Residential schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system)\". \r\n\r\nThe natural brain biochemistry of these folk didn't suddenly change overnight. No genetic mutation suddenly somehow retrospectively swept their culture. Rather, their way of life, their beliefs, their freedoms, hopes and dreams had been assaulted by the political decisions and resulting social conditions at the time.\r\n\r\nToday Indigenous children are more likely to grow up without access to the basic determinants of health, which Talaga lists as including income, status, clean water and air, decent accommodation, supportive families and communities, education, healthcare and a connection to their traditions. The absence of these basics negatively affects their physical, mental and social health.\r\n\r\nA related critique of the \"DSM-5\" type categorisation approach to mental illness was made by the British Psychological society in [their response](https://dxrevisionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsm-5-2011-bps-response.pdf) to the development of the that system.\r\n\r\n>...systems such as this are based on identifying problems as located within individuals.\r\nThis misses the relational context of problems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems\r\n\r\nIn all this I want to remember that it's very likely that some mental illness does have a biochemical, brain or genetic basis that might be directly treatable in more conventional ways. Few people seem to argue against the idea that pharmaceuticals in this sphere do have their uses. They may be necessary even when the underlying cause of an issue isn't due to unusual brain chemistry. But cannot be the be-all and end-all of interventions when the cause of the condition being treated lies outside of the person.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  it may bring comfort to those with particular suffering to have a medicalised label. If nothing else it provides a valuable recognition that those around them can acknowledge, understand and treat. Perhaps a sense that your pain is real, and can be addressed. It may be reassuring in some sense to feel biologically unlucky as opposed to blameworthy. But of course issue there is more about the invalid and illogical misuse of blame concepts. \r\n\r\nA categorisation also provides a potential identity that allows them to seek out a peer group of those who face similar battles. This might be beneficial either in terms of learning strategies to tackle the issue directly, or by providing a social group of people with a common interest who you know understand rather than stigmatise you. \r\n\r\nDespite my general skepticism about the benefits of social networks, this does seem like one possible use of these technologies, perhaps [especially for rarer conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116909/). In 2016, Naslund et al. [wrote](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/future-of-mental-health-care-peertopeer-support-and-social-media/DC0FB362B67DF2A48D42D487ED07C783)\r\n\r\n> People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness.\r\n\r\nA potential downside I can imagine may be risk of the person ending up feeling like \"they are their illness\" and that it's a fixed and permanent trait as opposed to something that can often be addressed. It may also be damaging if the idea that those outside the peer group can't help, and perhaps are even not to be trusted is cultivated. But overall, these types of peer groups are likely invaluable - \"given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks\", to quote the Naslund paper.\r\n\r\nWhilst I'm don't get the sense that this way of thinking is particularly routine in healthcare today, there have been a few interventions that do seem to acknowledge the social, political and environmental causes and exacerbations of mental health issues. \r\n\r\nRecently the results of a [National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/) intervention that involved the prescribing of heating [reported success](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63707689). \"Prescribing heating\" simply means paying the home heating bills for patients who cannot afford to do so themselves. This is an increasing number given the[ dramatic increase in energy costs](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119567595/households-across-the-u-k-are-about-experience-an-80-jump-in-energy-costs) in recent times. \r\n\r\nMany illnesses and other reductions in quality of life are caused or exacerbated by living in cold environs.  It's estimated that 10,000 people a year die of cold home related issues. Dealing with the other health consequences of cold homes costs the NHS ¬£860 million a year. Most of the reporting on this trial addresses physical illnesses, such as respiratory or circulatory conditions, rather than mental illnesses, but [the report that calculated the ¬£860 million figure](https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf) does note that living in cold or otherwise inadequate homes can also have a severe impact on mental health.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 we saw a \"social prescribing\" initiative that would enable doctors [to prescribe therapeutic art or hobby based treatments](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/) for instance. Related trials so far have shown improvements in patients physical and mental health. This approach is one potential plank of the Government's [anti-loneliness strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936725/6.4882_DCMS_Loneliness_Strategy_web_Update_V2.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe NHS notes that social prescribing is effective for a [wide range of people](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/), including those who need support with their mental health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists agrees, [reporting](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/social-prescribing)) that social prescribing helps people connect to their community in a way that can improve their health, both physical and mental. \r\n\r\nOf course, as with almost anything, there's a risk of taking this idea too far. We must avoid people being \"socially-prescribed\" to on the basis that it's a simpler or cheaper option than the alternatives (if it is - I don't know). \r\n\r\nIt will not be a suitable solution for everyone. The Royal College of Psychiatrists notes that it, in isolation, social prescribing will only likely be sufficient treatment [for patients with mild mental illnesses](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/position-statements/position-statement-ps01-21---social-prescribing---2021.pdf). For moderate or severe conditions, more traditional forms of therapy and medication are still usually to be recommended, with social prescribing being considered as an accompaniment if suitable. Social prescribing might potentially also play a role in the prevention of these conditions originating in the first place.\r\n\r\nSocial prescribing is of course only one intervention that addresses the idea that the way we live is causing many mental health issues.\r\n\r\nMany, perhaps most, future interventions may take place outside of the healthcare system. This is particularly the case if we continue to imagine healthcare as being something that you access when you're already ill rather than a service that helps lessens the likelihood of the illness in the first pace. \r\n\r\nOne example currently outside of the domain of the UK healthcare system - although the line often seems somewhat arbitrary to me - are food banks. Food banks exist to directly address the problem of people going hungry by giving free food parcels to people who are in such a state of destitution that they cannot otherwise obtain food. In the UK these are typically run by charities or NGOs, such the [Trussell Trust,](https://www.trusselltrust.org/) who have stepped up where the state has dramatically and unnecessarily failed its citizenry.  \r\n\r\nAccording to [a report](https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/dd06f2f2-bea9-46ff-941c-1d8849dce077/Mental%20Health%20Report%20-%20Final%200303.pdf) by mental health social worker Tom Pollard, the increasing demand for food banks is driven simply by an increasing number people not having enough income to buy food.  This phenomena is growing dramatically, driven by conscious, visible, political choices such as cuts to social security support, insecure employment practices and rising house costs.  43% of households on Universal Credit benefits experienced food insecurity in 2019-2020. \r\n\r\nIntuitively this seems a solvable problem. As the report says:\r\n\r\n> It is not right that people need to rely on charity handouts to get by. Our social security system, at both a local and national level, and our economy, should ensure that everyone is able to afford food and other basics.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the struggle to not starve, the lack of personal agency, the feeling of failure and the cognitive effort required to  jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to access these services can come at a great cost to mental health. And all this to typically receive a one-off package containing up to 3 days worth of food - enough to not starve to death right now, but it surely can't do a lot for the person's ongoing peace of mind and ability to live a fulfilling life. \r\n\r\nIn the words of the Big Issue's [writeup of the report](https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/heartbreaking-reports-from-food-bank-users-show-mental-health-impact-of-poverty/), \r\n\r\n> Soaring UK poverty forcing people to use food banks is creating a 'toxic environment' for their mental health.\r\n\r\n[A third](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/very-high-numbers-of-foodbank-users-have-mental-health-problems-and-disabilities-report) of households relying on these services include someone with mental health problems. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the use of foodbanks is stigmatised by some, with potential users reporting feelings of shame, anxiety and embarrassment at the thought of even visiting such an establishment. The film \"[I, Daniel Blake](https://trakt.tv/movies/i-daniel-blake-2016)\" portrays this kind of situation, and many of the other life-crushing effects of poverty in an effective and harrowing way. \r\n\r\n[There are certainly people](https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/foodbank-users-volunteers-reveal-shame-19155607) who don't seek even this most meagre assistance due to the shame they feel. The same goes for welfare benefits in general, as the recipients of those too are routinely shamed and abused by our elected officials, the media and the public at large.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, [polling](https://www.theweek.co.uk/73738/benefits-stigma-means-10bn-goes-unclaimed) showed that most claimants feel shame sometimes, most or all of the time, with one in four potential claimants deferring or declining to apply for the assistance they are absolutely entitled to for this reason. Analysis suggested that a ball-park figure of ¬£10-15 billion per year in benefits went unclaimed in 2016. For what it's worth, this is roughly 5-8x the estimate for the value of benefit fraud during the same period, if I read [the Government report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664827/fraud-and-error-stats-release-2016-17-final-estimates.pdf) correctly.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, [one study](https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/universal-credit-mental-health/) found an association between how many people are claiming benefits in an area and the amount of prescriptions for anti-depressants. For every 1% increase in people in a Local Authority area claiming Universal Credit there was a 5.6% increase in anti-depressants. \r\n\r\nWith all these type of associative studies, the direction of causality is usually not clear. Does having mental health problems make you more likely to need to claim benefits? Or does the experience of claiming benefits and the limits of the life you can live on them lead to mental health problems? My assumption is that both are true to some extent, although I haven't looked much into work in this area.  \r\n\r\nThe [Covid Realities project](https://covidrealities.org/) did however find instances of people describing the latter:\r\n\r\n> ...parents and carers living on a low-income reported experiences of stress, anxiety and low mood associated with claiming Universal Credit, connected to financial insecurity and the overall inadequacy of payments.\r\n\r\nIn any case, there is clearly a set of people that both have distressing mental health conditions and live in poverty. Solving the latter is a moral imperative in its own right, and the direction of evidence would suggest that doing so would likely \"automatically\" improve the former.\r\n\r\nFor those that are able to claim Universal Credit, the Government increased the amount of some entitlements by ¬£20 in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. This was presumably intended to assist with the increased financial pressure on those that already received benefits, and also those that the pandemic would end up forcing into the position of requiring them. After a year of Covid-19 raging the number of Universal Credit claimants had nearly doubled, up to 6 million recipients. \r\n\r\nThis ¬£20 boost was well-received by anti-poverty campaigners.  However in October 2021, despite the pandemic very much still being with us and inflation making the cost of living ever more unbearable for the non-wealthy, the Government [chose to abolish](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58812609) even that ¬£20 increase. \r\n\r\nMany experts and campaign groups pleaded with them to not go ahead with that cut, including [Mental Health UK](https://mentalhealth-uk.org/), who [highlighted the dangerous loop effect](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-cut-sees-catastrophic-21695217) between mental health and poverty.\r\n\r\n> This is not just a financial issue; we‚Äôre very concerned these pressures will result in more people seeing their mental health problems spiral, in turn making it difficult to manage their money worries and sending them deeper into the red.\r\n\r\nThe [British Psychological Society](https://www.bps.org.uk/) had similar concerns:\r\n\r\n> This decision will see health inequalities widen, placing more pressure on our already stretched and underfunded public services, as well as intensifying the mental health difficulties of people already struggling with rising debts, reduced income and soaring living costs.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Government went ahead with the cut, forcing people's lives into trajectories likely to cause or exacerbate mental illness. This was a political choice to knowingly create an environment that endangered mental health. Sure, some of the fallout symptomology might be treatable with medication (which comes with its own costs, financial and otherwise). But the suffering may never have occurred in the first place had we not consciously changed our societal environment in such a way. \r\n\r\nThere are clearly numerous other ways we might think about enabling poorer people access to money, unhoused people to accommodation, lonely people to socialisation, hungry people to food, exploited workers to quality jobs, people who suffer prejudice to equity, people with disabilities to a full and happy life and so on. Many of these might be much more creative and affirming than simply providing food and income enough to live a tolerable life to those who need it - although doing that might well be a good, necessary and urgent first step given the dire situation we currently find ourselves in. \r\n\r\nBut however we choose to address the subject, whilst taking care not to remove or reduce access to conventional medical therapies to those that need them, putting the foundations in place to solve the structural issues that in part cause the need in the first place is surely the sane response to an insane state of affairs.\r\n",

And secondly that the data being silently collected from you has some monetary value. A cookie paywall gives you the choice of how you want the website to extract value from you - pay with money or pay with data.\r\n\r\nI was also interested to learn the amount typically charged for opting out of such tracking at present. In the examples the paper surveyed it ranged between 2.99 and 6.25 euros per month. Honestly I can't see all that many people taking the imposition and [risks](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites) of being tracked seriously enough to pay that kind of amount, particularly if it's something you have to set up on each individual website you visit. It's also hard for me to imagine that most people's behaviour data on most sites is truly \"worth\" 75 euros a year.\n",

I&rsquo;d wonder about what would happen if society ever decided to reverse some of the more ingrained ones.

For men age 15-24, suicide rates are 126 per 100,000 vs 24 per 10000 for non-Indigenous young men.</li>\n<li>In the US, Native Americans commit suicide 3-10x the national average.</li>\n<li>The Indigenous people in the Amazonas,  Brazil are 4.8% of the state&rsquo;s population but 19% of suicides.</li>\n<li>5.5% of Australia Aboriginal deaths are suicide vs 1.7% in the non-Indigenous population.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The high Indigenous suicide rate has only been seen in modern times. Rates were low in Canada before the forced resettlement and Indian Residential Schools.</p>\n<p>Colonised people share a story:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historical injustices of colonisation</li>\n<li>Forced eviction from their land, by death or segregation.</li>\n<li>Erasure of their culture and identity caused by government and religious policy.</li>\n<li>Intergenerational trauma from experiences of poverty, abuse and oppression.</li>\n<li>Exposure to suicidal tendencies.</li>\n<li>Discriminatory legislation, now and in the past</li>\n<li>Substance abuse and violence triggered by being economically, socially and culturally marginalised.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indigenous children grow up without access to the basic determinants of health:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Income.</li>\n<li>Status.</li>\n<li>Clean water and air.</li>\n<li>Safe houses.</li>\n<li>Supportive families and communities.</li>\n<li>Education.</li>\n<li>Health care.</li>\n<li>A connection to their traditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The historical separation from their land and culture has left a spiritual emptiness. Traditionally Indigenous Nations have a connection to the land, believing that humans are part of a continuum of life on Earth and have the responsibility to safeguard the land for the next generation; everyone has a purpose.</p>\n<p>Impressions of Indigenous people held by colonist nations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before 1492 (Christopher Columbus),  &ldquo;Noble Savages&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>In the 19th century: social Darwinism was used to justify hierarchies of class, race and ethnicity, in line with Imperial desires.</li>\n<li>In the 20th century, portrayals in film and TV by non-Indigenous actors created a stereotypical image of an Indian wearing a headdress on a horse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One reason these stereotypes abound is that it&rsquo;s very rare that any written narrative from Indigenous people are publicised. For example the Indian Residential School system was excluded from Canadian school curricula for years, meaning the majority of Canadians weren&rsquo;t aware of the parent-child separation and forced assimilation the Indigenous people were subject to.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous worldview is of being cyclically connected to the Earth, to the Spirit and to each other. This is different to the typical Judeo-Christian Western outlook which sees humans as top of a hierarchy, supported by the creation story, bolstered by evolutionary theory.</p>\n<p>Western thinking tends towards the linear, from the viewpoints of psychology, science, rationality, as opposed to spiritual or cyclical thinking. Indigenous people have thus been measured against a definition of intelligence that undermines their culture, traditions and knowledge.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s evidence that Indigenous people have lived in Australia, Canada and the Americas for thousands of years, in large and complex societies with their own customs, laws, systems of governance, cultures, moral codes, monarchs, chieftains and evidence of some form of democracy years before Europeans even discussed it</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-brothers-hunger\">Big Brother&rsquo;s Hunger</h2>\n<p>150,000 Indigenous Canadian children were separated from their parents and sent to residential schools. From 1880-1996 139 church-run government-funded such schools existed. Their intent was to convert the children to Christianity and isolate them from their homes, traditions and culture in order to assimilate them into the &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; way of life. In some, children were regularly physically and sexually abused, left hungry - one even used an electric chair for punishment.</p>\n<p>The US had similar schools, founded by Captain Pratt who believed Indians were born as blank slates, and removing them from their culture and family structure would let them be shaped into Americans. The children&rsquo;s hair was cut, their names changed and their native languages forbidden.</p>\n<p>Huge mines have destroyed swathes of boreal forests, preventing them taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. Resulting displacement of water has further damaged ecosystems.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Big Brother demands what Little Brother has in order to feed its industry, construct its sprawling urban housing developments, and manufacture goods for its consumer-driven society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The arrival of fur traders changed the Indigenous relationship with the land. Before then they only hunted for what they needed and shared with others. Now there was an incentive to take as much as possible.</p>\n<p>The arrival of Christian missionaries changed their relationship with the Creator, fragmenting and imposing a new belief system.</p>\n<p>Churches claimed they couldn&rsquo;t do their missionary work effectively because people were spread throughout the land. The Indian Act was created to force Indigenous people onto concentrated reserves, and formed the residential schools to take their children away.</p>\n<p>In 1493, Pope Alexander VI created &ldquo;papal bulls&rdquo;, aka the Doctrine of Discovery, to legitimise the Spanish Empire&rsquo;s conquest of the Americas. They introduced the concept of &ldquo;land belonging to no-one&rdquo; - terra nullius.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For First Peoples that phrase implies the land belongs to everyone - land cannot be owned.</li>\n<li>The Catholic Church and European Empires interpreted it as land ripe for acquiring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They ignored the existence of the First People in terms of land rights at the same time as acknowledging their population as a way of increasing Christianity&rsquo;s dominance.</p>\n<p>After the US declared independence from Great Britain in 1776 no account was made in the treaties for the sovereignty of the Native American Nations. Acquisition and occupation of their land was legalised via hundreds of individual treaties with different Indigenous Nations - a divide and conquer strategy.</p>\n<p>Very few of the terms and conditions supposedly granted to Indigenous peoples in these treaties were actually upheld.</p>\n<p>The 1830 Indian Removal Act permitted the US president to resettle all American Indians east of the Mississippi river. Those that resisted e.g. the Cherokee were forcibly removed, held in prison camps. Thousands died from disease, exposure or starvations - the &ldquo;Trail of Tears&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>When miners found gold in Indigenous lands there was an effort to kill all the buffalo - destroying the food source, hunting grounds and way of life of the Plains Indians severed their attachment to the land and allowed the miners to move in.</p>\n<p>In Canada the 1876 Indian Act was introduced to govern all aspects of Indigenous people&rsquo;s lives - land management, education, culture, identity etc.</p>\n<p>~6000 children died due to mistreatment in the Indian Residential schools.</p>\n<p>Even though the Inuit were not covered by the act, similar tactics were used against them. There the RCMP killed their sled dogs, severing the source of sustenance, economy and the ability to travel far to visit friends or hunt. The population grew listless, with an existential and spiritual emptiness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The policy of extermination, isolation, and assimilation repeats itself in the history of Indigenous Nations throughout the world, and still continues today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Brazil, sugar cane plantations used Indigenous and African slave labour. The Indigenous people suffered epidemics of tuberculosis, measles, influenza, venereal disease, eye ailments as well as torture and extermination. Those left in the reservations were often ruled by Jesuits - &ldquo;religious concentration camps&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In the 1950s-1960s the Brazilian genocide continued, driven by a boom in rubber production. Their indigenous people, e.g. the Guarani people, are still under violent attack today, in violation of international law.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-third-space\">The Third Space</h2>\n<p>The &ldquo;third space&rdquo; is a blank space between Aboriginal culture and non-Aboriginal culture.</p>\n<p>In Indigenous cultures family units differ from the western traditional nuclear 1-house family by consisting of large networks of strong kinship, sometimes the entire community.</p>\n<p>Between 1910-1970, the Australian government removed ~ 50,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands children from their homes - the &ldquo;Stolen Generations&rdquo;. The policy was influenced by social Darwinism theory - as a supposedly inferior race these people would either die out naturally or be assimilated into white society.</p>\n<p>Currently Aboriginal youth are often born into unstable surroundings, to parents with substance abuse issues, extreme poverty, social exclusion or who never had the chance to acquire the skills needed to raise children.</p>\n<p>Without a large scale mental health system to support them, it&rsquo;s left to the people suffering to try and find their way back to health.</p>\n<p>Trauma isolates people from each other, making it unlikely they&rsquo;ll reach out to others. The only time you feel safe is when you are complete alone.</p>\n<p>Sexual abuse is a key driver of Indigenous communities' high suicide rate in Canada.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The suicide rate amongst young Indigenous women in a Canadian province was 30x higher than same-aged non-Indigenous women, vs 6x higher in males.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to understand what it&rsquo;s like to grow up in an environment where suicide is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; if you are not part of one of these communities.</p>\n<p>Risk factors of suicide include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in-womb exposure to alcohol</li>\n<li>growing up in an overcrowded house</li>\n<li>malnutrition</li>\n<li>food insecurity</li>\n<li>neglect</li>\n<li>sexual abuse</li>\n<li>close relatives dying by suicide (potentially leading to suicide clusters).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experiences, behaviours or inherited characteristics that come from things like stable homes, no abuse, good education and a connection to culture act as protective factors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is clear is that at the heart of the suicides is a lack of the determinants of health and social equity ‚Äî health care, housing, and a safe environment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the US, Native American youth are 2x as likely to be exposed to domestic violence, sexual abuse, substance abuse and poverty vs other groups.</p>\n<p>Indigenous population suicides also suffer from underreporting or inaccuracies, due to lack of access to medical treatment and epidemiological tracking.</p>\n<p>Being exposed to a previous generation of your family that went through residential school associates with an increased risk for suicide ideation. If two generations then increased chance of reporting a suicide attempt vs being exposed to just one.</p>\n<p>Chandler and Lalonde hypothesise that part of adolescent development is a search for a sense of belonging.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Scooping&rdquo; Indigenous children to place with white foster families is an issue in Canada, Australia and Brazil.</p>\n<p>This increased dramatically in the 1960s. The welfare workers used Euro-Canadian ways and values of child raising to judge the conditions of Indigenous families. If they saw the families ate only wild game, berries and vegetables, or saw some of the social issues associated with reserves (e.g. poverty, addiction), they assumed the child was in danger. Undoubtedly they often believed they were helping the child. But taking the child away induces trauma from the separation from community and family and damage to their identity development.</p>\n<p>Today less than 8% of Canadian children under 4 years old are Indigenous but they represent 51% of preschoolers in foster care.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-breathe-for-them\">I Breathe For Them</h2>\n<p>Facebook is a widely used communication tool in isolated Indigenous communities. They&rsquo;ve attended events discussing suicide due to their potential in detecting suicidal behaviour online.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous worldview that body, mind and spirit are connected have led to holistic healing practices, traditions, medicine and spiritual leaders/counsellors that take responsibility for an individual&rsquo;s entire physical, spiritual and mental health. This is unlike the Western medicine approach which offers different specialists and tools for each component of health.</p>\n<p>Many Indigenous people do not trust the Western health system, understandable after a history of having being removed from their land and families, quarantined and confined to &ldquo;Indian hospitals&rdquo; with discriminatory behaviour. They can be reluctant to access care for fear that it will not be culturally appropriate and may result in them being removed from their community.</p>\n<p>Potentially harmful experiments have been done without consent on Indigenous populations,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Between 1942-1952, Dr Percy Moore performed nutritional experiments on children in residential schools without consent, involving malnourishing children. Some died.</li>\n<li>The BCG vaccine was tested on infants without parental consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the British example of locking women who were believed to be prostitutes up in hospitals under the Contagious Diseases Act, &ldquo;Lock hospitals&rdquo; were established in Australian territory supposedly to treat Aboriginal women for venereal disease.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>90% of Aboriginal people in central Australia reported wanting alternatives to hospital care, vs 47% of non-Aboriginal people.</li>\n<li>1/3 of American Indian and Alaskan Native population don&rsquo;t have access to a doctor or clinic.</li>\n<li>1/3 of Native Americans don&rsquo;t have health insurance, vs 11% of White Americans.</li>\n<li>The life expectancy of Native Americans is 5.5 years lower than others, for reasons including &ldquo;inadequate education, disproportionate poverty, discrimination in the delivery of health services, and cultural differences&rdquo;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the 1920s the government created segregated Indian hospitals. Community and city hospitals refused to treat Indigenous patients or kept them in separate wards, often  overcrowded, badly ventilated or in other bad conditions.</p>\n<p>Racially segregated hospitals were common for other populations too in early 20th century Canada, e.g. wards for Chinese and Japanese patients.</p>\n<p>It used to be believed that TB got more virulent when an Indigenous person contracted it. The death rates from TB were particularly higher for children living in residential schools. But their illness was often ignored or improperly treated.</p>\n<p>Some scholars believe that South African legislators studied the Canadian Indian Act as part of creating apartheid.</p>\n<p>In 1953 an amendment to the Indian Act made it illegal for an Indigenous person to refuse to see a doctor, go to hospital or attempt to leave a hospital before being discharged.</p>\n<p>If a patient died in hospital their family was responsible for the cost of transporting the body home. They often couldn&rsquo;t afford to do this, so many Indigenous bodies were buried in unmarked graveyards far from home.</p>\n<p>Most Indian hospitals closed in the 1960s, but the healthcare of Indigenous people is still deficient. This is despite the fact that since 2007 Article 24(2) of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that Indigenous people have the right to access the same standard of health care as non-Indigenous people.</p>\n<p>Housing shortages make it hard to raise stable families.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indigenous children are 2x as likely to die before the age of 1 as others.</li>\n<li>In Canada half of all First Nations children live in poverty. Their life expectancy is 5-7 years less than other Canadians.</li>\n<li>Secondary school graduation rates on reserves at 35% vs 75% for non-Indigenous children.</li>\n<li>Indigenous people are overrepresented in prisons.</li>\n<li>In some communities opioid use is very high - 80% of more, yet addiction counsellors are rare.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Canadian medical system isn&rsquo;t designed to take into account the current day impacts of historical systemic racism.</p>\n<p>There are no doctors in NAN communities, and nursing stations are poorly equipped. First Nations lack healthcare, medication, treatment for chronic illnesses, diagnostic equipment. The Ambulance Act, Fire Prevention and Protection Act and Health Care Quality Act do not apply.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The system isn&rsquo;t broken; it is designed to do what it is doing.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>True reconciliation requires rights and legislation.</p>\n<p>Adverse childhood experiences impact a child&rsquo;s later health outcomes. Sexual abuse is one of the most damaging forms. 80% of suicide attempts from young people can be connected to adverse events. The risk of suicide remains high over the sufferer&rsquo;s entire life.</p>\n<p>Interventions should be designed and implemented by Indigenous people and communities.  The Sami National Centre on Mental Health and Substance Abuse (SANKS) is an example of this being done in Scandinavia.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-are-not-going-anywhere\">We Are Not Going Anywhere</h2>\n<p>The Parliament of Canada in Ottawa sits on the unceded territory of the Algonquins.</p>\n<p>In 2017, PM Trudeau committed to a renewal of Canada&rsquo;s relationship with Indigenous Peoples, eventually leading to removing the Indian Act.</p>\n<p>Participants of the determiNATION conference agreed that Indigenous peoples' self governance should not be enforced by the Indian Act. There should be no requirement to abandon cultural and spiritual practices, assimilate into the dominant society, have reserves governed by the federal government or have to register to be considered &ldquo;real Indians&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The same year the Joint Action Table Health Transformation Work Plan was signed which aims to develop a decolonised community-driven health system that gives adequate funding and permits the First Nations to be in control of their healthcare.</p>\n<p>Governments can&rsquo;t give &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; - they should not be the ones to determine who is or isn&rsquo;t Indigenous.</p>\n<p>The Dakota Access Pipeline was to be constructed in a way to damage sacred sites, contaminate drinking water and violate treaty rights. Whilst it ended up going ahead, the protest was the first time that many Indigenous Nations came together in peaceful protest.</p>\n<p>The Canadian state education system deliberately keeps the general population unaware of the physical, cultural and spiritual genocide that Indigenous Peoples have been subject to over time. It teaches about &ldquo;nation-building&rdquo;, but in a way that treats Aboriginal people as bystanders or obstacles. This reinforces the idea that white European civilisation is superior to the Indigenous civilisation.</p>\n<p>Lawmakers, judges, politicians et al thus grew up without learning the real history of their country; and this lack of knowledge shaped the policies, rules and programs they create. Non-Indigenous people haven&rsquo;t truly been able to understand the calls for justice by the Indigenous leaders.</p>\n<p>Many teachers have decided to learn and teach more about Canada&rsquo;s true history, even without direction by the government.</p>\n<p>Reconciliation requires actions to end social inequity. In Nunangat, the median Inuit income is 23% of the non-Inuit income, and they have rates of TB 250x higher than other Canadians.</p>\n<p>There have been hopeful developments, with the government creating a Quality of Life Secretariat to lead suicide prevention initiatives.</p>\n<p>The strategy also supports reducing overcrowding, poverty and crime, and re-examining the justice system. As well as high incarceration rates amongst Indigenous people, there are calls to incorporate Indigenous laws, traditions and restorative justice into the system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is clear that Indigenous Nations must be given the political and moral authority over their own communities that historically they have been denied</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Traditionally Indigenous Nations have a connection to the land, believing that humans are part of a continuum of life on Earth and have the responsibility to safeguard the land for the next generation; everyone has a purpose.\n\nImpressions of Indigenous people held by colonist nations:\n- Before 1492 (Christopher Columbus),  \"Noble Savages\". \n- In the 19th century: social Darwinism was used to justify hierarchies of class, race and ethnicity, in line with Imperial desires. \n- In the 20th century, portrayals in film and TV by non-Indigenous actors created a stereotypical image of an Indian wearing a headdress on a horse. \n\nOne reason these stereotypes abound is that it's very rare that any written narrative from Indigenous people are publicised. For example the Indian Residential School system was excluded from Canadian school curricula for years, meaning the majority of Canadians weren't aware of the parent-child separation and forced assimilation the Indigenous people were subject to.\n\nThe Indigenous worldview is of being cyclically connected to the Earth, to the Spirit and to each other. This is different to the typical Judeo-Christian Western outlook which sees humans as top of a hierarchy, supported by the creation story, bolstered by evolutionary theory. \n\nWestern thinking tends towards the linear, from the viewpoints of psychology, science, rationality, as opposed to spiritual or cyclical thinking. Indigenous people have thus been measured against a definition of intelligence that undermines their culture, traditions and knowledge.\n\nThere's evidence that Indigenous people have lived in Australia, Canada and the Americas for thousands of years, in large and complex societies with their own customs, laws, systems of governance, cultures, moral codes, monarchs, chieftains and evidence of some form of democracy years before Europeans even discussed it\n\n## Big Brother's Hunger\n\n150,000 Indigenous Canadian children were separated from their parents and sent to residential schools. From 1880-1996 139 church-run government-funded such schools existed. Their intent was to convert the children to Christianity and isolate them from their homes, traditions and culture in order to assimilate them into the \"Canadian\" way of life. In some, children were regularly physically and sexually abused, left hungry - one even used an electric chair for punishment.\n\nThe US had similar schools, founded by Captain Pratt who believed Indians were born as blank slates, and removing them from their culture and family structure would let them be shaped into Americans. The children's hair was cut, their names changed and their native languages forbidden.\n\nHuge mines have destroyed swathes of boreal forests, preventing them taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. Resulting displacement of water has further damaged ecosystems.\n\n>Big Brother demands what Little Brother has in order to feed its industry, construct its sprawling urban housing developments, and manufacture goods for its consumer-driven society.\n\nThe arrival of fur traders changed the Indigenous relationship with the land. Before then they only hunted for what they needed and shared with others. Now there was an incentive to take as much as possible.\n\nThe arrival of Christian missionaries changed their relationship with the Creator, fragmenting and imposing a new belief system.\n\nChurches claimed they couldn't do their missionary work effectively because people were spread throughout the land. The Indian Act was created to force Indigenous people onto concentrated reserves, and formed the residential schools to take their children away.\n\nIn 1493, Pope Alexander VI created \"papal bulls\", aka the Doctrine of Discovery, to legitimise the Spanish Empire's conquest of the Americas. They introduced the concept of \"land belonging to no-one\" - terra nullius.\n- For First Peoples that phrase implies the land belongs to everyone - land cannot be owned.\n- The Catholic Church and European Empires interpreted it as land ripe for acquiring.\n\nThey ignored the existence of the First People in terms of land rights at the same time as acknowledging their population as a way of increasing Christianity's dominance.\n\nAfter the US declared independence from Great Britain in 1776 no account was made in the treaties for the sovereignty of the Native American Nations. Acquisition and occupation of their land was legalised via hundreds of individual treaties with different Indigenous Nations - a divide and conquer strategy.\n\nVery few of the terms and conditions supposedly granted to Indigenous peoples in these treaties were actually upheld.\n\nThe 1830 Indian Removal Act permitted the US president to resettle all American Indians east of the Mississippi river. Those that resisted e.g. the Cherokee were forcibly removed, held in prison camps. Thousands died from disease, exposure or starvations - the \"Trail of Tears\".\n\nWhen miners found gold in Indigenous lands there was an effort to kill all the buffalo - destroying the food source, hunting grounds and way of life of the Plains Indians severed their attachment to the land and allowed the miners to move in.\n\nIn Canada the 1876 Indian Act was introduced to govern all aspects of Indigenous people's lives - land management, education, culture, identity etc. \n\n~6000 children died due to mistreatment in the Indian Residential schools.\n\nEven though the Inuit were not covered by the act, similar tactics were used against them. There the RCMP killed their sled dogs, severing the source of sustenance, economy and the ability to travel far to visit friends or hunt. The population grew listless, with an existential and spiritual emptiness.\n\n> The policy of extermination, isolation, and assimilation repeats itself in the history of Indigenous Nations throughout the world, and still continues today.\n\nIn Brazil, sugar cane plantations used Indigenous and African slave labour. The Indigenous people suffered epidemics of tuberculosis, measles, influenza, venereal disease, eye ailments as well as torture and extermination. Those left in the reservations were often ruled by Jesuits - \"religious concentration camps\".\n\nIn the 1950s-1960s the Brazilian genocide continued, driven by a boom in rubber production. Their indigenous people, e.g. the Guarani people, are still under violent attack today, in violation of international law. \n\n## The Third Space\n\nThe \"third space\" is a blank space between Aboriginal culture and non-Aboriginal culture.\n\nIn Indigenous cultures family units differ from the western traditional nuclear 1-house family by consisting of large networks of strong kinship, sometimes the entire community.\n\nBetween 1910-1970, the Australian government removed ~ 50,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands children from their homes - the \"Stolen Generations\". The policy was influenced by social Darwinism theory - as a supposedly inferior race these people would either die out naturally or be assimilated into white society.\n\nCurrently Aboriginal youth are often born into unstable surroundings, to parents with substance abuse issues, extreme poverty, social exclusion or who never had the chance to acquire the skills needed to raise children. \n\nWithout a large scale mental health system to support them, it's left to the people suffering to try and find their way back to health.\n\nTrauma isolates people from each other, making it unlikely they'll reach out to others. The only time you feel safe is when you are complete alone.\n\nSexual abuse is a key driver of Indigenous communities' high suicide rate in Canada.\n- The suicide rate amongst young Indigenous women in a Canadian province was 30x higher than same-aged non-Indigenous women, vs 6x higher in males.\n\nIt's hard to understand what it's like to grow up in an environment where suicide is \"normal\" if you are not part of one of these communities.\n\nRisk factors of suicide include:\n- in-womb exposure to alcohol\n- growing up in an overcrowded house\n- malnutrition\n- food insecurity\n- neglect\n- sexual abuse\n- close relatives dying by suicide (potentially leading to suicide clusters). \n\nExperiences, behaviours or inherited characteristics that come from things like stable homes, no abuse, good education and a connection to culture act as protective factors.\n\n> What is clear is that at the heart of the suicides is a lack of the determinants of health and social equity ‚Äî health care, housing, and a safe environment\n\nIn the US, Native American youth are 2x as likely to be exposed to domestic violence, sexual abuse, substance abuse and poverty vs other groups.\n\nIndigenous population suicides also suffer from underreporting or inaccuracies, due to lack of access to medical treatment and epidemiological tracking.\n\nBeing exposed to a previous generation of your family that went through residential school associates with an increased risk for suicide ideation. If two generations then increased chance of reporting a suicide attempt vs being exposed to just one.\n\nChandler and Lalonde hypothesise that part of adolescent development is a search for a sense of belonging.\n\n\"Scooping\" Indigenous children to place with white foster families is an issue in Canada, Australia and Brazil. \n\nThis increased dramatically in the 1960s. The welfare workers used Euro-Canadian ways and values of child raising to judge the conditions of Indigenous families. If they saw the families ate only wild game, berries and vegetables, or saw some of the social issues associated with reserves (e.g. poverty, addiction), they assumed the child was in danger. Undoubtedly they often believed they were helping the child. But taking the child away induces trauma from the separation from community and family and damage to their identity development.\n\nToday less than 8% of Canadian children under 4 years old are Indigenous but they represent 51% of preschoolers in foster care.\n\n## I Breathe For Them\n\nFacebook is a widely used communication tool in isolated Indigenous communities. They've attended events discussing suicide due to their potential in detecting suicidal behaviour online.\n\nThe Indigenous worldview that body, mind and spirit are connected have led to holistic healing practices, traditions, medicine and spiritual leaders/counsellors that take responsibility for an individual's entire physical, spiritual and mental health. This is unlike the Western medicine approach which offers different specialists and tools for each component of health.\n\nMany Indigenous people do not trust the Western health system, understandable after a history of having being removed from their land and families, quarantined and confined to \"Indian hospitals\" with discriminatory behaviour. They can be reluctant to access care for fear that it will not be culturally appropriate and may result in them being removed from their community.\n\nPotentially harmful experiments have been done without consent on Indigenous populations,\n- Between 1942-1952, Dr Percy Moore performed nutritional experiments on children in residential schools without consent, involving malnourishing children. Some died. \n- The BCG vaccine was tested on infants without parental consent.\n\nFollowing the British example of locking women who were believed to be prostitutes up in hospitals under the Contagious Diseases Act, \"Lock hospitals\" were established in Australian territory supposedly to treat Aboriginal women for venereal disease.\n\n- 90% of Aboriginal people in central Australia reported wanting alternatives to hospital care, vs 47% of non-Aboriginal people.\n- 1/3 of American Indian and Alaskan Native population don't have access to a doctor or clinic.\n- 1/3 of Native Americans don't have health insurance, vs 11% of White Americans.\n- The life expectancy of Native Americans is 5.5 years lower than others, for reasons including \"inadequate education, disproportionate poverty, discrimination in the delivery of health services, and cultural differences\".\n\nIn the 1920s the government created segregated Indian hospitals. Community and city hospitals refused to treat Indigenous patients or kept them in separate wards, often  overcrowded, badly ventilated or in other bad conditions. \n\nRacially segregated hospitals were common for other populations too in early 20th century Canada, e.g. wards for Chinese and Japanese patients.\n\nIt used to be believed that TB got more virulent when an Indigenous person contracted it. The death rates from TB were particularly higher for children living in residential schools. But their illness was often ignored or improperly treated.\n\nSome scholars believe that South African legislators studied the Canadian Indian Act as part of creating apartheid.\n\nIn 1953 an amendment to the Indian Act made it illegal for an Indigenous person to refuse to see a doctor, go to hospital or attempt to leave a hospital before being discharged.\n\nIf a patient died in hospital their family was responsible for the cost of transporting the body home. They often couldn't afford to do this, so many Indigenous bodies were buried in unmarked graveyards far from home.\n\nMost Indian hospitals closed in the 1960s, but the healthcare of Indigenous people is still deficient. This is despite the fact that since 2007 Article 24(2) of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that Indigenous people have the right to access the same standard of health care as non-Indigenous people. \n\nHousing shortages make it hard to raise stable families.\n\n- Indigenous children are 2x as likely to die before the age of 1 as others.\n- In Canada half of all First Nations children live in poverty. Their life expectancy is 5-7 years less than other Canadians. \n- Secondary school graduation rates on reserves at 35% vs 75% for non-Indigenous children.\n- Indigenous people are overrepresented in prisons.\n- In some communities opioid use is very high - 80% of more, yet addiction counsellors are rare.\n\nThe Canadian medical system isn't designed to take into account the current day impacts of historical systemic racism.\n\nThere are no doctors in NAN communities, and nursing stations are poorly equipped. First Nations lack healthcare, medication, treatment for chronic illnesses, diagnostic equipment. The Ambulance Act, Fire Prevention and Protection Act and Health Care Quality Act do not apply.\n\n>\"The system isn't broken; it is designed to do what it is doing.\"\n\nTrue reconciliation requires rights and legislation.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences impact a child's later health outcomes. Sexual abuse is one of the most damaging forms. 80% of suicide attempts from young people can be connected to adverse events. The risk of suicide remains high over the sufferer's entire life.\n\nInterventions should be designed and implemented by Indigenous people and communities.  The Sami National Centre on Mental Health and Substance Abuse (SANKS) is an example of this being done in Scandinavia.\n\n## We Are Not Going Anywhere\n\nThe Parliament of Canada in Ottawa sits on the unceded territory of the Algonquins.\n\nIn 2017, PM Trudeau committed to a renewal of Canada's relationship with Indigenous Peoples, eventually leading to removing the Indian Act.\n\nParticipants of the determiNATION conference agreed that Indigenous peoples' self governance should not be enforced by the Indian Act. There should be no requirement to abandon cultural and spiritual practices, assimilate into the dominant society, have reserves governed by the federal government or have to register to be considered \"real Indians\".\n\nThe same year the Joint Action Table Health Transformation Work Plan was signed which aims to develop a decolonised community-driven health system that gives adequate funding and permits the First Nations to be in control of their healthcare.\n\nGovernments can't give \"belonging\" - they should not be the ones to determine who is or isn't Indigenous.\n\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline was to be constructed in a way to damage sacred sites, contaminate drinking water and violate treaty rights. Whilst it ended up going ahead, the protest was the first time that many Indigenous Nations came together in peaceful protest.\n\nThe Canadian state education system deliberately keeps the general population unaware of the physical, cultural and spiritual genocide that Indigenous Peoples have been subject to over time. It teaches about \"nation-building\", but in a way that treats Aboriginal people as bystanders or obstacles. This reinforces the idea that white European civilisation is superior to the Indigenous civilisation.\n\nLawmakers, judges, politicians et al thus grew up without learning the real history of their country; and this lack of knowledge shaped the policies, rules and programs they create. Non-Indigenous people haven't truly been able to understand the calls for justice by the Indigenous leaders.\n\nMany teachers have decided to learn and teach more about Canada's true history, even without direction by the government.\n\nReconciliation requires actions to end social inequity. In Nunangat, the median Inuit income is 23% of the non-Inuit income, and they have rates of TB 250x higher than other Canadians.\n\nThere have been hopeful developments, with the government creating a Quality of Life Secretariat to lead suicide prevention initiatives.\n\nThe strategy also supports reducing overcrowding, poverty and crime, and re-examining the justice system. As well as high incarceration rates amongst Indigenous people, there are calls to incorporate Indigenous laws, traditions and restorative justice into the system.\n\n> It is clear that Indigenous Nations must be given the political and moral authority over their own communities that historically they have been denied\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m not a member of any political party at the time of writing. This is the UK norm, with only around <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/i-was-curious.html\">850k people</a> being affiliated to any party in that way, out of an electorate of around 47 million.</p>\n<p>For years I&rsquo;ve felt uneasy about so directly supporting a party when all of them usually have some policy or other I firmly disagree with, especially without feeling like I&rsquo;ve had enough resources at hand to work towards enacting change from within.</p>\n<p>In more recent times I&rsquo;ve also not felt I&rsquo;ve understood what any of the parties not in currently in power even really stand for. I&rsquo;ve ended up voting for various left-leaning parties over the years depending on the situation at the time.</p>\n<p>However, in the present time of a truly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism\">dangerous</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/the-last-days-of-truss-were-an-utter-shambles-then-the-real-chaos-began\">chaotic</a> government, my previous rationales have started to feel potentially like weak excuses to me personally. I decided to try and figure out what the only other party that realistically at this point could win a national election, Labour, stands for to see if I could feel comfortable more directly supporting them. If <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-poll-lead-tory-wipeout_uk_634d98a6e4b0b7f89f59852c\">recent polling</a> carried forth into actual votes they&rsquo;d in fact have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory\">landslide victory</a></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t love <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/\">the Labour website</a>. The first thing you see is a form requesting your contact details on top of a somewhat nausea-inducing background video sequence. Then, inevitably, a cookies popup that as far as I can see you can&rsquo;t actually <em>decline</em>, along with a donation popup.</p>\n<p>But get through all of that and there&rsquo;s a link to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/issue/economic-growth/\">Labour&rsquo;s vision for Britain</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>It looks like right now their number one priority is a plan for economic growth. This is understandable given the recent devastation of the economy by the present government and the impact this has had, and will have in future, on British citizens, even if I&rsquo;m <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/economic-growth/506423/\">not convinced</a> that economic growth is the necessarily the measure a good society should optimise for. Historically though it has at least correlated with a lot of good things, but perhaps only <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0\">up to a point</a>.</p>\n<p>As to what they plan to do to fix the situation, much of the plan seems to be based on British job creation and industrial strategy.</p>\n<p>At a glance I am good with the idea of altering business rates to promote investment, fairer competition and creating a council to inject a sense of long-term strategic thinking.  I&rsquo;m nowhere near expert enough to know whether these are plausible approaches to the problems at hand, but at least there&rsquo;s an intuitive reasonableness we can later determine if there&rsquo;s any evidence to back it up.</p>\n<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s easy to say &ldquo;we want more fair and good green jobs&rdquo;- so as always the devil will be in the detail, but it&rsquo;s a reasonable vision to have.</p>\n<p>In former days it&rsquo;d be one of those annoying generic slogans that it&rsquo;s hard to really imagine any mainstream party being against. But it actually doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anywhere near the top of the list of Conservative priorities - quite <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/75000-green-jobs-lost-under-the-conservatives-as-labour-calls-for-rapid-green-investment/\">the opposite</a>. At times the Conservatives seem <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/tories-culture-war-win-back-popular-support-670637\">desperate to inject culture-war topics</a> into the UK political sphere which isn&rsquo;t going to help on anything environmental.</p>\n<p>What other concrete policies are Labour pursuing these days? To get a sense of their current priorities I checked out their <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/issues/campaigns/\">campaigns page</a>. Here&rsquo;s roughly what I gathered from a trawl of the various sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"employment\">Employment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boost people&rsquo;s income - better pay will improve the economy as well as tackle the cost of living crisis.</li>\n<li>Ban zero hours contracts and &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; self-employment.</li>\n<li>End the &ldquo;qualifying periods&rdquo; some jobs have that mean people have to wait up to 2 years to realise certain rights, including unfair dismissal, sick pay and parental leave.</li>\n<li>Update trade union legislation for the modern era, removing certain restrictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"energy\">Energy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop the energy price cap rising, by taxing high oil and gas profits.</li>\n<li>Ensure people who have prepayment meters don&rsquo;t pay more for energy than everyone else.</li>\n<li>Insulate all homes that need it.</li>\n<li>Invest in sustainable British energy (wind, tidal, solar) and back nuclear energy.</li>\n<li>Create a publicly owned energy company that delivers energy independence and security with 100% clean power by 2030.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"economy\">Economy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Build industries in every region of the UK.</li>\n<li>Invest in electric car batteries, green steel, renewable ready ports.</li>\n<li>Create a national wealth fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"security\">Security</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Recruit 13,000 extra police / PCSO officers to rebuild neighbourhood policing</li>\n<li>Improve training, vetting and misconduct procedures.</li>\n<li>Introduce rules on strip-searching children.</li>\n<li>Address the epidemic of violence against women/girls, including introducing domestic abuse experts.</li>\n<li>Crack down on the criminal gangs who trade in people.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"health\">Health</h3>\n<p>Expand the NHS workforce by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>doubling the number of medical school places and district nurses qualifying per year.</li>\n<li>creating an additional 10,000 nursing/midwifery placements per year.</li>\n<li>training 5000 new health visitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"education\">Education</h3>\n<p>Primary school education: &ldquo;Build a Britain where children come first&rdquo; - this one was extremely vague.</p>\n<h3 id=\"home-ownership\">Home ownership</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Target 70% home ownership.</li>\n<li>Build high quality affordable homes</li>\n<li>Reform the private rented sector</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"some-of-the-things-i-liked-in-what-i-saw\">Some of the things I liked in what I saw:</h2>\n<p>An emphasis on not just creating jobs, but ensuring they are secure, decent and paid well enough to provide a decent life. The fact that even under the current highly stigmatising welfare regime a whole lot of people claiming benefits, or even needing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40431701\">to make use of food banks</a>, need to do so despite the fact they they have paid jobs is absurd.</p>\n<p>Banning zero hours contact and fake self-employment feels like a good sentiment in general to reduce the abuse of folk in for example the gig economy. It is plausible to me that zero hours contracts could be used in a way beneficial to all in some limited cases so I don&rsquo;t know if a full ban is the correct answer. However they&rsquo;re right to identify that, surprise surprise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/mar/27/the-bullying-and-fear-at-the-heart-of-zero-hour-contracts\">that&rsquo;s not what actually happens at present</a> so it might be a good policy in net terms.</p>\n<p>The green stuff: targeting of jobs and industry towards green industries, insulating homes, investing in green energy et al. The environment is the disaster-in-progress that may finally ruin the quality of or even end some of our lives if nothing else gets us first. Actually it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns\">already is doing so</a>. Mitigating climate change should be a priority for every party, particularly as we already know a lot of what needs to be done - it&rsquo;s a case of actually <em>doing</em> it.</p>\n<p>Expanding the NHS workforce, assuming this comes with investment. After the Covid pandemic and chronic mismanagement on the part of the Conservatives, the NHS is in a quite precarious state with huge waiting lists to catch up on - including 6 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high\">waiting to start hospital treatment</a>. Whether this expansion can happen fast enough to be the only major change needed I don&rsquo;t know - I would assume not - but it&rsquo;s clearly a necessary step for the future.</p>\n<p>A focus on domestic abuse and other violence against women, areas of crime that are unfortunately common and also very rarely prosecuted in many cases.</p>\n<p>Creating of a publicly owned energy company - to facilitate the shift towards green energy, but also to create jobs, reduce dependence on countries such as Russia, build resilience and in the end lower fuel bills. I&rsquo;m happy Labour aren&rsquo;t scared to introduce policies that might be seen as being at least in the <em>direction</em> of nationalising parts of some critical industries, even if they have gone out of their way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/great-british-energy-what-is-it-what-would-it-do-and-how-would-it-be-funded\">to make it clear</a> that we&rsquo;re not talking about nationalising existing companies.</p>\n<p>Taxing the vast profits of fossil fuel energy providers. This might prove somewhat impossible many cases when a lot of them are not British-situated companies. For those that are within the appropriate jurisdiction then it seems right to me to windfall-tax the profits of the energy producers which <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/05/05/oil-companies-massive-profits-first-quarter-russia-ukraine/\">have been incredible</a> at a time when the cost of energy to consumers has created a real crisis.</p>\n<p>Reforming the private rental sector - rents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/21/private-rents-britain-hit-record-high-demand-properties\">have never been higher</a>. A few years ago the Conservative MPs, many of whom are themselves landlords in addition to their day job(s), <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-vote-down-law-requiring-landlords-make-their-homes-fit-for-human-habitation-a6809691.html\">voted against</a> requiring landlords to make their homes be &lsquo;fit for human habitation&rsquo;. Reforming could mean many things, but I expect most of them would be better than today&rsquo;s situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-of-the-things-i-felt-wary-about\">Some of the things I felt wary about:</h2>\n<p>A lot of the security section. &ldquo;Crack down on human traffickers&rdquo; is the sort of detail-free statement that always worries me on this topic.</p>\n<p>It <em>could</em> mean creating compassionate policies to ensure people who want or need to get to the UK can do so in a safe and humane way to the benefit of us all. Or it could mean going full <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage\">Farage</a> and inventing wave machines to literally push boats full of some of the most vulnerable people in the world back into the sea.</p>\n<p>To be fair the latter idea was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12816615/home-office-wave-machine-migrants-channel/\">dreamt up</a> (and thankfully discarded) under a Conservative administration - but I imagine Farage would also be into it. At least Labour&rsquo;s plans do specifically include cancelling the ridiculous and awful plan to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61097114\">ship asylum seekers off to Rwanda</a>, which is a very good thing.</p>\n<p>But, outside of that specific point, my fear is that is this &lsquo;cracking down&rsquo; will be more in the latter direction. Starmer <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/23073096.keir-starmer-admits-little-difference-immigration-labour-tories/\">has specifically said</a> that there&rsquo;s very little substantive difference between his party&rsquo;s thinking on immigration and that of the Conservative Party. In a time where the official policy is to create a &lsquo;<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hostile-environment-the-uk-governments-draconian-immigration-policy-explained-95460\">hostile environment</a>&rsquo; in a way that may not even actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/25/hostile-environment-unlawful-ehrc-report-windrush-scandal-policy\">be legal</a>, this is the kind of thing that I find abhorrent enough to be extremely off-putting.

				"content_text": "I'm not a member of any political party at the time of writing. This is the UK norm, with only around [850k people](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/i-was-curious.html) being affiliated to any party in that way, out of an electorate of around 47 million. \r\n\r\nFor years I've felt uneasy about so directly supporting a party when all of them usually have some policy or other I firmly disagree with, especially without feeling like I've had enough resources at hand to work towards enacting change from within. \r\n\r\nIn more recent times I've also not felt I've understood what any of the parties not in currently in power even really stand for. I've ended up voting for various left-leaning parties over the years depending on the situation at the time. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the present time of a truly [dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism) and [chaotic](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/the-last-days-of-truss-were-an-utter-shambles-then-the-real-chaos-began) government, my previous rationales have started to feel potentially like weak excuses to me personally. I decided to try and figure out what the only other party that realistically at this point could win a national election, Labour, stands for to see if I could feel comfortable more directly supporting them. If [recent polling](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-poll-lead-tory-wipeout_uk_634d98a6e4b0b7f89f59852c) carried forth into actual votes they'd in fact have a [landslide victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory)\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't love [the Labour website](https://labour.org.uk/). The first thing you see is a form requesting your contact details on top of a somewhat nausea-inducing background video sequence. Then, inevitably, a cookies popup that as far as I can see you can't actually *decline*, along with a donation popup. \r\n\r\nBut get through all of that and there's a link to \"[Labour's vision for Britain](https://labour.org.uk/issue/economic-growth/)\". \r\n\r\nIt looks like right now their number one priority is a plan for economic growth. This is understandable given the recent devastation of the economy by the present government and the impact this has had, and will have in future, on British citizens, even if I'm [not convinced](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/economic-growth/506423/) that economic growth is the necessarily the measure a good society should optimise for. Historically though it has at least correlated with a lot of good things, but perhaps only [up to a point](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0).\r\n\r\nAs to what they plan to do to fix the situation, much of the plan seems to be based on British job creation and industrial strategy. \r\n\r\nAt a glance I am good with the idea of altering business rates to promote investment, fairer competition and creating a council to inject a sense of long-term strategic thinking.  I'm nowhere near expert enough to know whether these are plausible approaches to the problems at hand, but at least there's an intuitive reasonableness we can later determine if there's any evidence to back it up.\r\n\r\nObviously it's easy to say \"we want more fair and good green jobs\"- so as always the devil will be in the detail, but it's a reasonable vision to have. \r\n\r\nIn former days it'd be one of those annoying generic slogans that it's hard to really imagine any mainstream party being against. But it actually doesn't seem to be anywhere near the top of the list of Conservative priorities - quite [the opposite](https://labour.org.uk/press/75000-green-jobs-lost-under-the-conservatives-as-labour-calls-for-rapid-green-investment/). At times the Conservatives seem [desperate to inject culture-war topics](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/tories-culture-war-win-back-popular-support-670637) into the UK political sphere which isn't going to help on anything environmental.\r\n\r\nWhat other concrete policies are Labour pursuing these days? To get a sense of their current priorities I checked out their [campaigns page](https://labour.org.uk/issues/campaigns/). Here's roughly what I gathered from a trawl of the various sections.\r\n\r\n### Employment\r\n- Boost people's income - better pay will improve the economy as well as tackle the cost of living crisis.\r\n- Ban zero hours contracts and \"bogus\" self-employment. \r\n- End the \"qualifying periods\" some jobs have that mean people have to wait up to 2 years to realise certain rights, including unfair dismissal, sick pay and parental leave. \r\n- Update trade union legislation for the modern era, removing certain restrictions.\r\n\r\n### Energy\r\n- Stop the energy price cap rising, by taxing high oil and gas profits.\r\n- Ensure people who have prepayment meters don't pay more for energy than everyone else.\r\n- Insulate all homes that need it.\r\n- Invest in sustainable British energy (wind, tidal, solar) and back nuclear energy.\r\n- Create a publicly owned energy company that delivers energy independence and security with 100% clean power by 2030.\r\n\r\n### Economy\r\n- Build industries in every region of the UK.\r\n- Invest in electric car batteries, green steel, renewable ready ports.\r\n- Create a national wealth fund.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Recruit 13,000 extra police / PCSO officers to rebuild neighbourhood policing\r\n- Improve training, vetting and misconduct procedures.\r\n- Introduce rules on strip-searching children.\r\n- Address the epidemic of violence against women/girls, including introducing domestic abuse experts.\r\n- Crack down on the criminal gangs who trade in people. \r\n\r\n### Health\r\nExpand the NHS workforce by:\r\n\r\n- doubling the number of medical school places and district nurses qualifying per year. \r\n- creating an additional 10,000 nursing/midwifery placements per year. \r\n- training 5000 new health visitors. \r\n\r\n### Education\r\nPrimary school education: \"Build a Britain where children come first\" - this one was extremely vague. \r\n\r\n### Home ownership\r\n- Target 70% home ownership.\r\n- Build high quality affordable homes\r\n- Reform the private rented sector\r\n\r\n## Some of the things I liked in what I saw:\r\n\r\nAn emphasis on not just creating jobs, but ensuring they are secure, decent and paid well enough to provide a decent life. The fact that even under the current highly stigmatising welfare regime a whole lot of people claiming benefits, or even needing [to make use of food banks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40431701), need to do so despite the fact they they have paid jobs is absurd. \r\n\r\nBanning zero hours contact and fake self-employment feels like a good sentiment in general to reduce the abuse of folk in for example the gig economy. It is plausible to me that zero hours contracts could be used in a way beneficial to all in some limited cases so I don't know if a full ban is the correct answer. However they're right to identify that, surprise surprise, [that's not what actually happens at present](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/mar/27/the-bullying-and-fear-at-the-heart-of-zero-hour-contracts) so it might be a good policy in net terms.\r\n\r\nThe green stuff: targeting of jobs and industry towards green industries, insulating homes, investing in green energy et al. The environment is the disaster-in-progress that may finally ruin the quality of or even end some of our lives if nothing else gets us first. Actually it [already is doing so](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns). Mitigating climate change should be a priority for every party, particularly as we already know a lot of what needs to be done - it's a case of actually *doing* it.\r\n\r\nExpanding the NHS workforce, assuming this comes with investment. After the Covid pandemic and chronic mismanagement on the part of the Conservatives, the NHS is in a quite precarious state with huge waiting lists to catch up on - including 6 million people [waiting to start hospital treatment](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high). Whether this expansion can happen fast enough to be the only major change needed I don't know - I would assume not - but it's clearly a necessary step for the future.\r\n\r\nA focus on domestic abuse and other violence against women, areas of crime that are unfortunately common and also very rarely prosecuted in many cases.\r\n\r\nCreating of a publicly owned energy company - to facilitate the shift towards green energy, but also to create jobs, reduce dependence on countries such as Russia, build resilience and in the end lower fuel bills. I'm happy Labour aren't scared to introduce policies that might be seen as being at least in the *direction* of nationalising parts of some critical industries, even if they have gone out of their way [to make it clear](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/great-british-energy-what-is-it-what-would-it-do-and-how-would-it-be-funded) that we're not talking about nationalising existing companies.\r\n\r\nTaxing the vast profits of fossil fuel energy providers. This might prove somewhat impossible many cases when a lot of them are not British-situated companies. For those that are within the appropriate jurisdiction then it seems right to me to windfall-tax the profits of the energy producers which [have been incredible](https://fortune.com/2022/05/05/oil-companies-massive-profits-first-quarter-russia-ukraine/) at a time when the cost of energy to consumers has created a real crisis.\r\n\r\nReforming the private rental sector - rents [have never been higher](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/21/private-rents-britain-hit-record-high-demand-properties). A few years ago the Conservative MPs, many of whom are themselves landlords in addition to their day job(s), [voted against](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-vote-down-law-requiring-landlords-make-their-homes-fit-for-human-habitation-a6809691.html) requiring landlords to make their homes be 'fit for human habitation'. Reforming could mean many things, but I expect most of them would be better than today's situation.\r\n\r\n## Some of the things I felt wary about:\r\n\r\nA lot of the security section. \"Crack down on human traffickers\" is the sort of detail-free statement that always worries me on this topic.\r\n\r\nIt *could* mean creating compassionate policies to ensure people who want or need to get to the UK can do so in a safe and humane way to the benefit of us all. Or it could mean going full [Farage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage) and inventing wave machines to literally push boats full of some of the most vulnerable people in the world back into the sea. \r\n\r\nTo be fair the latter idea was [dreamt up](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12816615/home-office-wave-machine-migrants-channel/) (and thankfully discarded) under a Conservative administration - but I imagine Farage would also be into it. At least Labour's plans do specifically include cancelling the ridiculous and awful plan to [ship asylum seekers off to Rwanda](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61097114), which is a very good thing.\r\n\r\nBut, outside of that specific point, my fear is that is this 'cracking down' will be more in the latter direction. Starmer [has specifically said](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23073096.keir-starmer-admits-little-difference-immigration-labour-tories/) that there's very little substantive difference between his party's thinking on immigration and that of the Conservative Party. In a time where the official policy is to create a '[hostile environment](https://theconversation.com/hostile-environment-the-uk-governments-draconian-immigration-policy-explained-95460)' in a way that may not even actually [be legal](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/25/hostile-environment-unlawful-ehrc-report-windrush-scandal-policy), this is the kind of thing that I find abhorrent enough to be extremely off-putting. I couldn't defend it. \r\n\r\nI was disappointed there was almost nothing about education. My understanding is that the education workforce is depleted, of low morale and struggling with workload in an environment of damaging low budgets in a similar way to the NHS workforce. [A poll](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/11/teachers-england-plan-to-quit-workloads-stress-trust) suggested half of the teachers in England plan to quit within the next 5 years. Most experience various degrees of [poor mental health](https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/22/schools-and-mental-health-why-teachers-are-quitting-the-industry-17501832/?ico=zone-post-strip_item_1_news) due to their work. There's also the impact of the disruption to normal schooling practices on all concerned - students, teachers and parents - that the pandemic triggered.\r\n\r\nI'd actually have liked to see a specific mention of mental health in general.

				"title": "Yet more ramblings about AI generated art",
				"content_html": "<p>Ever since learning about the prevalence and progress of AI-generated art, mainly via such a piece having <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed\">won an art competition</a>, it&rsquo;s not left my mind for too long.  I was <a href=\"https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/should-artificial-intelligences-win-art-competitions/\">kind of confused</a> how best to think about it then, and it&rsquo;s only got worse as time goes on. Herein are some further ramblings.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, these are systems where you type in a prompt, e.g. &ldquo;Picture of a juggling elephant&rdquo; and out pops a picture of whatever you asked for. Right now the results aren&rsquo;t always great, hence the new vocation of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/so-you-want-to-be-a-prompt-engineer-critical-careers-of-the-future/\">prompt engineer</a>&rdquo; - someone who knows what phrases to give to an AI for best result. But they&rsquo;re often certainly good enough to be used commercially and beyond.</p>\n<p>There exist several famous such systems, including <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\">DALL-E</a>, <a href=\"https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release\">Stable Diffusion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/\">Midjourney</a>. Importantly, the way they work is dependent on them having processed vast arrays of existing, presumably human, art. This is typically sucked in from the internet without explicit permission from its creators. No-one really thinks computers just became innately artistic in the traditional sense; but rather that we developed algorithms that allow a computer to translate an arbitrary text string into an image output based on what it&rsquo;s derived from all the art and contextual information it&rsquo;s already seen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/09/what-exactly-is-ai-generated-art-how-does-it-work-will-it-replace-human-visual-artists\">This Guardian article</a> gives a quick overview of roughly how these systems work. The below video goes through some slightly more mathy details. \n<code>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CIpzeNxIhU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</code></p>\n<p>Given the genie is well and truly out of the bottle, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable that we&rsquo;ll see more and more usage of AI art over time. The systems are already perfectly usable by almost anyone who can use the web, and will only get cheaper and easier to use over time - for an individual end user even now it&rsquo;s often free. If nothing else, we can be confident that the capitalism&rsquo;s invisible hand typically pushes us towards the immediately cheapest - often meaning most generic and least human-skill-requiring - solution to any perceived need, no matter the external cost. You&rsquo;d basically need some kind of world-wide usage ban to stop it, which isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;ll be a set of people who are dead against the technology. It may well never replace human artists in their entirety.  But it&rsquo;s going to - and perhaps already has - replace a good number of them. In doing so, it&rsquo;ll inevitably change what the world looks like for the rest of us.</p>\n<p>After all, even if it turns out that the very &lsquo;best&rsquo; art is somehow only ever possible via human production, there&rsquo;s a ton of current use cases where fairly mediocre art is acceptable to businesses and individuals. Particularly when it&rsquo;s extremely cheap to produce.</p>\n<p>Automation replacing people in jobs is very much <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/01/19/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/\">not new</a>, but it&rsquo;s traditionally been seen un jobs with perhaps less visible output, considered more rote, and unfortunately probably thought of as being of lower status or worth than the typical romantic perception of the artist. Being an artist is aspirational, if sadly unobtainable, for many folk. That&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t plenty of unpleasant, tedious, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chances-success-arts-21st-century/\">ill-paid and abusive artistic jobs</a>. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be terrible if some of those disappear, as long as the people involved are cared for. But the trait of being &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; is often seen as a very human, and desirable trait. Those considered to be near the top of their game are widely admired and honoured.</p>\n<p>Whilst access to AI art generators is somewhat restricted or at least niche at present, that&rsquo;s inevitably not going be the case for long. Microsoft Office, that most unexciting and ubiquitous of workplace software, is gearing up to add  a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://designer.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Designer</a>&rdquo; component that generates illustrations based on the sentences you type. Their promo video shows someone creating a poster for their bakery business based on typing &ldquo;Cake with berries, bread and pastries for the fall&rdquo;, no graphic designer needed. I guess this is the modern day version of clipart.</p>\n<p><code>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/smvyxABRZTU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</code></p>\n<p>Stock photography as a business might also be on its way out, at least in terms of how it works today. Already there are stock photography sites that <a href=\"(https://www.stockai.com/)\">offer to generate you an AI-created image</a> if they don&rsquo;t already have something that meets your satisfaction. That&rsquo;s one less human photographer or artist receiving credit and payment for their work. In fact one of that site&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.stockai.com/tools/article-to-featured-image\">dedicated tools</a> reads your blog post text to create you an appropriate cover image. I might try that on this post just for fun when I&rsquo;m done.</p>\n<p>Update: I did just that. Here&rsquo;s the image <a href=\"https://www.stockai.com/\">stockai.com</a> generated when fed with the text from this post. It was free and took maybe 45 seconds.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/e41759a8f6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an example of how the technology could be additive rather than substitutional. There&rsquo;s no way I would have commissioned an artist or even browsed stock photography sites for this humble blogpost. No-one lost out (at least not <em>directly</em>, certainly the consequences of participating in shifting norms are debatable). But it also seems very unlikely that many profit-focussed companies who currently invest in some kind of artistic output will keep spending the money they currently do if they get idea that they don&rsquo;t need to into their heads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/\">The Atlantic</a> magazine already got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/ai-art-artificial-intelligence-midjourney-dall-e-replacing-artists\">some controversy</a> over using an AI generated image to illustrate one of its newsletters. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/\">The Economist</a> <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover\">used an AI</a> to design one of its covers. I&rsquo;m sure there are many more examples, whether we know about them or not. Let&rsquo;s also remember than an increasing number of the more mundane stories you <em>read</em> in certain publications are written by AIs - the <a href=\"https://www.techslang.com/how-is-automated-journalism-impacting-the-media/\">automated journalism</a> trend, so it&rsquo;s not only visual creativity at play here.</p>\n<p>But worrying about people losing jobs due to technology is seemingly not something society tends to do in earnest. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite\">Luddites</a> who literally battled the industrialisation of the textile business in 19th century England didn&rsquo;t win; they became an insult.</p>\n<p>Sentiments along the lines of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it, they&rsquo;ll just get better jobs right away&rdquo; or &ldquo;but this will make things cheaper which will benefit everyone in the end&rdquo; abound. Sometimes they might be true. Oftentimes probably the former isn&rsquo;t, at least whilst many of us live in societies that tend to see unemployment as a problem that must be solved by the individual rather than the system that caused it, whilst appearing to have little respect for article 25 of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. But <em>in theory</em> we could deal humanely and generously with unemployment of all kinds.</p>\n<p>What is less obvious to me is what a shift to most &ldquo;art&rdquo; we see day-to-day being generated by AI might do to harder-to-define concepts like creativity. The pictures that come out of these AI machines are &ldquo;new&rdquo; for sure, in that they never existed before. But they&rsquo;re all based on some black-box manipulation of existing, human-powered art for now. Some of this is very clear, such as prompts that explicitly request the combination of 2 human artworks that haven&rsquo;t previously been combined - such as &ldquo;Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner 2049&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">‚ÄúA still of Kermit The Frog in Blade Runner 2049 (2017)‚Äù <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dalle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#dalle</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CxyWFRJETc\">pic.twitter.com/CxyWFRJETc</a></p>&mdash; HeavensLastAngel (@HvnsLstAngel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HvnsLstAngel/status/1531506455714492416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>In other, more abstract cases, it&rsquo;s much less obvious.</p>\n<p>But in any case, the machine needs feeding.</p>\n<p>One might consider that human artists are also inspired by what they&rsquo;ve seen. To what extent is a human&rsquo;s art also a black box &ldquo;generative process&rdquo; based on all the artistic inputs they&rsquo;ve seen in their life? There&rsquo;s an way in which this has to be at least partly true within a certain scope, given &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement\">movements</a>&rdquo; exist in art - think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism\">Impressionism</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism\">Modernism</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism\">Neo-Classicism</a>, that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>But something starts those movements. What I don&rsquo;t know is whether that&rsquo;s something qualitatively different to the kind of generative process that the crop of AI art generators we might expect in the next few years could do. Or am I putting humanity on too much of a pedestal? Do we know that human creativity isn&rsquo;t deep down based on a not dissimilar process? Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t actually done any research into creativity really. There may exist very simple answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>But if there is an insurmountable difference, or simply if market forces et. al.  result in AIs being attuned towards a diminutive and limiting goal like &ldquo;optimise your output to please the most amount of people today&rdquo; then perhaps something will be lost, or at least delayed. Will future historians note a moment where the world got artistically stuck in some sense?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s of course possible I&rsquo;ve gotten this the wrong way round. An <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/\">AI playing the game of Go</a> beat its human opponent with moves so novel and unexpected that they&rsquo;ve been described as &lsquo;alien&rsquo; and &lsquo;from an alternate dimension&rsquo;. Maybe one day AI art generators will show us something valuable we&rsquo;d never otherwise have imagined.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some of the more concerning &ldquo;getting stuck&rdquo; effect has already happened to some extent via a different algorithmic use case. Witness for instance how Netflix has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/netflix-cancelled-series-soundtrack-tuca-and-bertie-chambers-spinning-out-mindhunter-a9365501.html\">changed its once acclaimed artistic output</a> based on what it&rsquo;s algorithms say will sell well. Look at the truly bizarre output that sometimes populates social media at present, where potentially artistic output gets optimised for engagement above anything. It might result in fascinating, important, meaningful new art forms. It can also result in a spate of videos of people <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/eating-ice-cream-out-of-a-toilet\">eating out of toilets</a> because at some point someone did it and the resulting video went viral.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear how &ldquo;new&rdquo; this is; I&rsquo;m sure art has always been driven by incentive. It may just be that accessibility and access to an audiences improved. It&rsquo;s much easier for me to share a video of myself eating ice-cream out of a toilet on Facebook than it would be for me to paint some kind of Mona Lisa-beating painting and set up an internationally renowned art gallery to show it off.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s often easy to forget that just because something is difficult doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo;. That sentiment is often a metaphorical barrier used to prohibit less privileged sections of  society making inroads into whatever sphere the existing powers-that-be want to protect for their own selfish purposes.</p>\n<p>A little less dramatically: should my blog go without illustration because I don&rsquo;t have either the talent or resources needed to go to art school?  But also, if I&rsquo;m not prepared to pay or credit an artist then do I really have the right to use an illustration that was overtly non-consensually derived from work of many other people? As these systems work by ingesting incredible amounts of other people&rsquo;s art, a whole set of rights issues exist.</p>\n<p>Being popular with the current AI art community is not necessarily a blessing for a human artist. <a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/rutkowski\">Greg Rutkowski</a>  is an artist known for fantasy landscapes. But his style is liked enough that his name has apparently <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/\">become a common prompt</a> for people using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to generate art, with tens of thousands of images being generated by typing in phrases including his name.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/\">example shown by the MIT Technology Review</a> used the prompt <em>‚ÄúWizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski&quot;</em> which produced this:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/960bd94de6.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>Now when Rutkowski Googles his name he gets art that isn&rsquo;t his. And he has no rights over the AI-generated images. So if some entity wants to use some work that an AI explicitly created   based on having ingested hundreds of his images without permission then they&rsquo;re presumably free to do so. This has understandably <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/a-i-should-exclude-living-artists-from-its-database-says-one-painter-whose-works-were-used-to-fuel-image-generators-2178352\">left him with the opinion</a> that &ldquo;A.I. should exclude living artists from its database&rdquo;.  Which prompts me to additionally wonder about if there&rsquo;s any ethical considerations of note surrounding the possible AI exploitation of a <em>dead</em> artist&rsquo;s work.</p>\n<p>For now though, if the artist&rsquo;s images are on the internet then they&rsquo;re considered fair game. These systems don&rsquo;t ask artists to opt in to having their work included, and it&rsquo;s not clear that they even have the ability to opt out them. Some tools that at might at least let you know if your work has been used to train these AI systems have started to appear, including <a href=\"https://haveibeentrained.com/\">Spawn&rsquo;s Have I Been Trained?</a>.</p>\n<p>To what extent this is different from a human artist enjoying Rutkowski&rsquo;s pictures and later creating something in a similar style is something that perhaps still needs to be thrashed out. After all, the ingested pictures were on the publicly accessible internet in the first place. But the big difference here is of course accessibility and scale. The new part is that is that a single person or business with no art knowledge or skill can generate hundreds of &ldquo;original&rdquo; Rutkowski style pictures a day with no artistic ability and little-to-no resources.</p>\n<p>This opens up new possibilities for the masses, which could be a positive thing - see <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/when-ai-makes-art/\">the optimistic possibility Wired presents</a> of &ldquo;dramatically expanding the number of people able to generate and experiment with art and illustration&rdquo;. But left without consideration, it may also result in a pretty devastating exploitation of people&rsquo;s hitherto highly valued work. And potentially a world where it feels like we&rsquo;re immersed in some kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel\">Borges' style Library of Babel</a> but for whichever genre of art is algorithmically popular or convenient, with a possible plot twist of any remaining human artists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnTheGranblue/status/1578632039326441472\">being accused of being AIs</a>.</p>\n",

But they're often certainly good enough to be used commercially and beyond. \r\n\r\nThere exist several famous such systems, including [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). Importantly, the way they work is dependent on them having processed vast arrays of existing, presumably human, art. This is typically sucked in from the internet without explicit permission from its creators. No-one really thinks computers just became innately artistic in the traditional sense; but rather that we developed algorithms that allow a computer to translate an arbitrary text string into an image output based on what it's derived from all the art and contextual information it's already seen.\r\n\r\n[This Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/09/what-exactly-is-ai-generated-art-how-does-it-work-will-it-replace-human-visual-artists) gives a quick overview of roughly how these systems work. The below video goes through some slightly more mathy details. \r\n```{{< youtube 1CIpzeNxIhU >}}```\r\n\r\nGiven the genie is well and truly out of the bottle, I think it's inevitable that we'll see more and more usage of AI art over time. The systems are already perfectly usable by almost anyone who can use the web, and will only get cheaper and easier to use over time - for an individual end user even now it's often free. If nothing else, we can be confident that the capitalism's invisible hand typically pushes us towards the immediately cheapest - often meaning most generic and least human-skill-requiring - solution to any perceived need, no matter the external cost. You'd basically need some kind of world-wide usage ban to stop it, which isn't going to happen.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there'll be a set of people who are dead against the technology. It may well never replace human artists in their entirety.  But it's going to - and perhaps already has - replace a good number of them. In doing so, it'll inevitably change what the world looks like for the rest of us.\r\n\r\nAfter all, even if it turns out that the very 'best' art is somehow only ever possible via human production, there's a ton of current use cases where fairly mediocre art is acceptable to businesses and individuals. Particularly when it's extremely cheap to produce.\r\n\r\nAutomation replacing people in jobs is very much [not new](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/01/19/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/), but it's traditionally been seen un jobs with perhaps less visible output, considered more rote, and unfortunately probably thought of as being of lower status or worth than the typical romantic perception of the artist. Being an artist is aspirational, if sadly unobtainable, for many folk. That's not to say there aren't plenty of unpleasant, tedious, [ill-paid and abusive artistic jobs](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chances-success-arts-21st-century/). Maybe it won't be terrible if some of those disappear, as long as the people involved are cared for. But the trait of being \"artistic\" is often seen as a very human, and desirable trait. Those considered to be near the top of their game are widely admired and honoured.\r\n\r\nWhilst access to AI art generators is somewhat restricted or at least niche at present, that's inevitably not going be the case for long. Microsoft Office, that most unexciting and ubiquitous of workplace software, is gearing up to add  a \"[Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/)\" component that generates illustrations based on the sentences you type. Their promo video shows someone creating a poster for their bakery business based on typing \"Cake with berries, bread and pastries for the fall\", no graphic designer needed. I guess this is the modern day version of clipart.\r\n\r\n```{{< youtube smvyxABRZTU >}}```\r\n\r\nStock photography as a business might also be on its way out, at least in terms of how it works today. Already there are stock photography sites that [offer to generate you an AI-created image]((https://www.stockai.com/)) if they don't already have something that meets your satisfaction. That's one less human photographer or artist receiving credit and payment for their work. In fact one of that site's [dedicated tools](https://www.stockai.com/tools/article-to-featured-image) reads your blog post text to create you an appropriate cover image. I might try that on this post just for fun when I'm done.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I did just that. Here's the image [stockai.com](https://www.stockai.com/) generated when fed with the text from this post. It was free and took maybe 45 seconds.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/e41759a8f6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThat's an example of how the technology could be additive rather than substitutional. There's no way I would have commissioned an artist or even browsed stock photography sites for this humble blogpost. No-one lost out (at least not *directly*, certainly the consequences of participating in shifting norms are debatable). But it also seems very unlikely that many profit-focussed companies who currently invest in some kind of artistic output will keep spending the money they currently do if they get idea that they don't need to into their heads. \r\n\r\n[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) magazine already got into [some controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/ai-art-artificial-intelligence-midjourney-dall-e-replacing-artists) over using an AI generated image to illustrate one of its newsletters. [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) [used an AI](https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover) to design one of its covers. I'm sure there are many more examples, whether we know about them or not. Let's also remember than an increasing number of the more mundane stories you *read* in certain publications are written by AIs - the [automated journalism](https://www.techslang.com/how-is-automated-journalism-impacting-the-media/) trend, so it's not only visual creativity at play here.\r\n\r\nBut worrying about people losing jobs due to technology is seemingly not something society tends to do in earnest. The [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) who literally battled the industrialisation of the textile business in 19th century England didn't win; they became an insult. \r\n\r\nSentiments along the lines of \"don't worry about it, they'll just get better jobs right away\" or \"but this will make things cheaper which will benefit everyone in the end\" abound. Sometimes they might be true. Oftentimes probably the former isn't, at least whilst many of us live in societies that tend to see unemployment as a problem that must be solved by the individual rather than the system that caused it, whilst appearing to have little respect for article 25 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). But *in theory* we could deal humanely and generously with unemployment of all kinds.\r\n\r\nWhat is less obvious to me is what a shift to most \"art\" we see day-to-day being generated by AI might do to harder-to-define concepts like creativity. The pictures that come out of these AI machines are \"new\" for sure, in that they never existed before. But they're all based on some black-box manipulation of existing, human-powered art for now. Some of this is very clear, such as prompts that explicitly request the combination of 2 human artworks that haven't previously been combined - such as \"Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner 2049\"\r\n\r\n{{< tweet user=\"hvnslstangel\" id=\"1531506455714492416\" >}}\r\n\r\nIn other, more abstract cases, it's much less obvious. \r\n\r\nBut in any case, the machine needs feeding.\r\n\r\nOne might consider that human artists are also inspired by what they've seen. To what extent is a human's art also a black box \"generative process\" based on all the artistic inputs they've seen in their life? There's an way in which this has to be at least partly true within a certain scope, given \"[movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement)\" exist in art - think [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism), [Modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism), [Neo-Classicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism), that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nBut something starts those movements. What I don't know is whether that's something qualitatively different to the kind of generative process that the crop of AI art generators we might expect in the next few years could do. Or am I putting humanity on too much of a pedestal? Do we know that human creativity isn't deep down based on a not dissimilar process? Disclaimer: I haven't actually done any research into creativity really. There may exist very simple answers to these questions.\r\n\r\nBut if there is an insurmountable difference, or simply if market forces et. al.  result in AIs being attuned towards a diminutive and limiting goal like \"optimise your output to please the most amount of people today\" then perhaps something will be lost, or at least delayed. Will future historians note a moment where the world got artistically stuck in some sense? \r\n\r\nIt's of course possible I've gotten this the wrong way round. An [AI playing the game of Go](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/) beat its human opponent with moves so novel and unexpected that they've been described as 'alien' and 'from an alternate dimension'. Maybe one day AI art generators will show us something valuable we'd never otherwise have imagined.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of the more concerning \"getting stuck\" effect has already happened to some extent via a different algorithmic use case. Witness for instance how Netflix has [changed its once acclaimed artistic output](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/netflix-cancelled-series-soundtrack-tuca-and-bertie-chambers-spinning-out-mindhunter-a9365501.html) based on what it's algorithms say will sell well. Look at the truly bizarre output that sometimes populates social media at present, where potentially artistic output gets optimised for engagement above anything. It might result in fascinating, important, meaningful new art forms. It can also result in a spate of videos of people [eating out of toilets](https://www.garbageday.email/p/eating-ice-cream-out-of-a-toilet) because at some point someone did it and the resulting video went viral. \r\n\r\nIt's not clear how \"new\" this is; I'm sure art has always been driven by incentive. It may just be that accessibility and access to an audiences improved. It's much easier for me to share a video of myself eating ice-cream out of a toilet on Facebook than it would be for me to paint some kind of Mona Lisa-beating painting and set up an internationally renowned art gallery to show it off. \r\n\r\nIt's often easy to forget that just because something is difficult doesn't mean that it's \"better\". That sentiment is often a metaphorical barrier used to prohibit less privileged sections of  society making inroads into whatever sphere the existing powers-that-be want to protect for their own selfish purposes. \r\n\r\nA little less dramatically: should my blog go without illustration because I don't have either the talent or resources needed to go to art school?  But also, if I'm not prepared to pay or credit an artist then do I really have the right to use an illustration that was overtly non-consensually derived from work of many other people? As these systems work by ingesting incredible amounts of other people's art, a whole set of rights issues exist.\r\n\r\nBeing popular with the current AI art community is not necessarily a blessing for a human artist. [Greg Rutkowski](https://www.artstation.com/rutkowski)  is an artist known for fantasy landscapes. But his style is liked enough that his name has apparently [become a common prompt](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/) for people using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to generate art, with tens of thousands of images being generated by typing in phrases including his name. \r\n\r\nAn [example shown by the MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/) used the prompt *‚ÄúWizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski\"* which produced this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/960bd94de6.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nNow when Rutkowski Googles his name he gets art that isn't his. And he has no rights over the AI-generated images. So if some entity wants to use some work that an AI explicitly created   based on having ingested hundreds of his images without permission then they're presumably free to do so. This has understandably [left him with the opinion](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/a-i-should-exclude-living-artists-from-its-database-says-one-painter-whose-works-were-used-to-fuel-image-generators-2178352) that \"A.I. should exclude living artists from its database\".  Which prompts me to additionally wonder about if there's any ethical considerations of note surrounding the possible AI exploitation of a *dead* artist's work.\r\n\r\nFor now though, if the artist's images are on the internet then they're considered fair game. These systems don't ask artists to opt in to having their work included, and it's not clear that they even have the ability to opt out them. Some tools that at might at least let you know if your work has been used to train these AI systems have started to appear, including [Spawn's Have I Been Trained?](https://haveibeentrained.com/). \r\n\r\nTo what extent this is different from a human artist enjoying Rutkowski's pictures and later creating something in a similar style is something that perhaps still needs to be thrashed out. After all, the ingested pictures were on the publicly accessible internet in the first place. But the big difference here is of course accessibility and scale. The new part is that is that a single person or business with no art knowledge or skill can generate hundreds of \"original\" Rutkowski style pictures a day with no artistic ability and little-to-no resources. \r\n\r\nThis opens up new possibilities for the masses, which could be a positive thing - see [the optimistic possibility Wired presents](https://www.wired.com/story/when-ai-makes-art/) of \"dramatically expanding the number of people able to generate and experiment with art and illustration\". But left without consideration, it may also result in a pretty devastating exploitation of people's hitherto highly valued work. And potentially a world where it feels like we're immersed in some kind of [Borges' style Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) but for whichever genre of art is algorithmically popular or convenient, with a possible plot twist of any remaining human artists [being accused of being AIs](https://twitter.com/OnTheGranblue/status/1578632039326441472).\n",

				"content_html": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/95088b9340.jpg\" width=\"216\" alt=\"\" />\n<p><em>(My book notes aim to summarise the parts of the book that most attracted my attention, perhaps reworded or reorganised, and don‚Äôt necessarily reflect whether I agree or disagree with them. I‚Äôm very open to discussions as to whether I&rsquo;ve missed or misunderstood anything).</em></p>\n<p>Toussaint Louverture was an enslaved Black person. He later achieved freedom and went on to become a  leading figure of the Haitian revolution.</p>\n<p>After the French revolution, there were demands for self-government and equal rights for free people of colour in Saint-Domingue, a French Caribbean colony. There was a uprising of the enslaved people in 1791 which led to the abolition of slavery by the in the colony 2 years later.</p>\n<p>Toussaint was born a slave, became freed, rose through the military ranks to become a French general and eventually became the governor of Saint-Domingue. He had an enlightenment mindset, believing in the power of scientific ideas leading to a better society, including via education and economic reform</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reason and education will spread across our regenerated soil; once crushed under a yoke of enslavement which was as odious as it was grading, man will elevate himself on the wings of liberty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His emphasis was on racial equality, conducting a just war of liberation - driven directly by the efforts and sacrifices of Black slaves, not White liberals. The victory was evidence against the commonly held belief that European people and culture were inherently superior.</p>\n<p>He proved an inspiration to many during and after his life, becoming an inspiration for other such uprisings and causing panic amongst slave owners worldwide. He later featured in many artistic works.</p>\n<p>Saint Domingue was claimed by Spain when Christopher Columbus landed in 1642. It became the world&rsquo;s largest producer of sugar and coffee, and also exported other resources such as cotton, indigo and cacao. The owners of capital became very rich during the 18th century. But this was built on a bedrock of extreme inequality, with half a million people enslaved by the late C18th.  Enslaved people had no rights and were often treated extremely cruelly. However here they formed brotherhoods, practicing &lsquo;voudou&rsquo; rituals, dance, singing etc. Many, known as marrons, escaped to hide, form groups and promote emancipation.</p>\n<p>There was also a mixed race population, who were free (and occasionally wealthy). But they had fewer rights than white people, with legal discriminations keeping them separate and less privileged - bans on certain types of employment, some segregation and more.</p>\n<p>Toussaint Louverture joined the fight in 1791. He was a complex, mysterious, controversial person, concealing information about himself, his movements and specific goals via misinformation and rumours.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;a man who managed to make himself&hellip;invisible where he was, and visible where he was not</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He was emancipated more than 10 years before the revolution, and even owned slaves for a while. Many people see his rule as starting out emancipatory, but becoming authoritarian, for example by refusing to allow the poorer classes to buy small sections of land, and introducing extremely restrictive employment laws, including forced labour, and the import of workers via the slave trade. He claimed the governor appointment for life with the right to choose his successor.</p>\n<p>He had a strong sense of determination and was not shy of dwelling on his own role in all successes. His power was grounded by his republican army, as well as the free Black population which embraced the principles of freedom, equality and justice, but also the colony&rsquo;s administrative structures, White planter and business class, as well as the Catholic church, whose religion he followed.</p>\n<p>Whilst exposed to and adhering to European Enlightenment thinking, he reformulated it to fit local conditions, appropriating universal concepts to specific local issues such as slavery, racial hierarchy and the definition of Blackness.</p>\n<p>He was known for being close to nature, and an intuitive genius, coming from his local upbringing and experiences. But he also defined himself as a man of reason, being familiar with European views on republicanism and philosophy - with a particular attachment to the common good, equality in dignity, freedom and independence from dependency on other states. His republicanism was rooted in military practice, liberation from slavery and occupation, integrating local traditions of mysticism, royalism, Catholicism and brotherhood - desiring a multiracial community of equals.</p>\n<p>He appears an extremely brave and skilled fighter, often clawing his way to victory on the front lines of the battlefield. He was also a master of using negotiation, misinformation, distraction and diplomatic abilities to make progress towards this goals in other ways.</p>\n<p>He reflected on his Blackness as a matter of heritage, pride, duty and honour, trying to occupy the moral high ground,  promoting Black interests generally without feelings of revenge or disparagement against the White people. He claimed that the best way to respond to evil was to do good. His vision appeared to be that of equality between races, with his senior officials often being drawn from the White or mixed-race population.

I‚Äôm very open to discussions as to whether I've missed or misunderstood anything)._\n\n\nToussaint Louverture was an enslaved Black person. He later achieved freedom and went on to become a  leading figure of the Haitian revolution. \n\nAfter the French revolution, there were demands for self-government and equal rights for free people of colour in Saint-Domingue, a French Caribbean colony. There was a uprising of the enslaved people in 1791 which led to the abolition of slavery by the in the colony 2 years later.\n\nToussaint was born a slave, became freed, rose through the military ranks to become a French general and eventually became the governor of Saint-Domingue. He had an enlightenment mindset, believing in the power of scientific ideas leading to a better society, including via education and economic reform\n\n>Reason and education will spread across our regenerated soil; once crushed under a yoke of enslavement which was as odious as it was grading, man will elevate himself on the wings of liberty.\n\nHis emphasis was on racial equality, conducting a just war of liberation - driven directly by the efforts and sacrifices of Black slaves, not White liberals. The victory was evidence against the commonly held belief that European people and culture were inherently superior.\n\nHe proved an inspiration to many during and after his life, becoming an inspiration for other such uprisings and causing panic amongst slave owners worldwide. He later featured in many artistic works.\n\nSaint Domingue was claimed by Spain when Christopher Columbus landed in 1642. It became the world's largest producer of sugar and coffee, and also exported other resources such as cotton, indigo and cacao. The owners of capital became very rich during the 18th century. But this was built on a bedrock of extreme inequality, with half a million people enslaved by the late C18th.  Enslaved people had no rights and were often treated extremely cruelly. However here they formed brotherhoods, practicing 'voudou' rituals, dance, singing etc. Many, known as marrons, escaped to hide, form groups and promote emancipation.\n\nThere was also a mixed race population, who were free (and occasionally wealthy). But they had fewer rights than white people, with legal discriminations keeping them separate and less privileged - bans on certain types of employment, some segregation and more.\n\nToussaint Louverture joined the fight in 1791. He was a complex, mysterious, controversial person, concealing information about himself, his movements and specific goals via misinformation and rumours.\n\n>...a man who managed to make himself...invisible where he was, and visible where he was not\n\nHe was emancipated more than 10 years before the revolution, and even owned slaves for a while. Many people see his rule as starting out emancipatory, but becoming authoritarian, for example by refusing to allow the poorer classes to buy small sections of land, and introducing extremely restrictive employment laws, including forced labour, and the import of workers via the slave trade. He claimed the governor appointment for life with the right to choose his successor.\n\nHe had a strong sense of determination and was not shy of dwelling on his own role in all successes. His power was grounded by his republican army, as well as the free Black population which embraced the principles of freedom, equality and justice, but also the colony's administrative structures, White planter and business class, as well as the Catholic church, whose religion he followed.\n\nWhilst exposed to and adhering to European Enlightenment thinking, he reformulated it to fit local conditions, appropriating universal concepts to specific local issues such as slavery, racial hierarchy and the definition of Blackness.\n\nHe was known for being close to nature, and an intuitive genius, coming from his local upbringing and experiences. But he also defined himself as a man of reason, being familiar with European views on republicanism and philosophy - with a particular attachment to the common good, equality in dignity, freedom and independence from dependency on other states. His republicanism was rooted in military practice, liberation from slavery and occupation, integrating local traditions of mysticism, royalism, Catholicism and brotherhood - desiring a multiracial community of equals.\n\nHe appears an extremely brave and skilled fighter, often clawing his way to victory on the front lines of the battlefield. He was also a master of using negotiation, misinformation, distraction and diplomatic abilities to make progress towards this goals in other ways.\n\nHe reflected on his Blackness as a matter of heritage, pride, duty and honour, trying to occupy the moral high ground,  promoting Black interests generally without feelings of revenge or disparagement against the White people. He claimed that the best way to respond to evil was to do good. His vision appeared to be that of equality between races, with his senior officials often being drawn from the White or mixed-race population. He punished anyone who caused harm to even the former slave owners.\n\nIn 1801 he created a new constitution for the colony. Article 3 read:\n\n> There cannot exist slaves...servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French\n\n\nWhilst the constitution was not a declaration of independence, France felt it was damaging to their interests. Despite his incredible journey, in 1802 he was arrested by France under Napoleon, and died in jail the year after. \n\n> In overthrowing me you have cut down in Saint Domingue only the trunk of the tree of liberty; it will spring up again from the roots, for they are numerous and they are deep\n\nSince then, he has often been a figure of inspiration and veneration especially in terms of the battle for emancipation, and has been featured in many artistic works.\n",

				"title": "The next UK crisis: mortgage payments?",
				"content_html": "<p>Mortgage payments look to be one of the next crises the UK is going to have to stare into the existential void of, or do something about.</p>\n<p>Not content with folk being unable to afford food to eat or energy to heat, it seems like housing may be the next to go. Even for those people who are rich or lucky enough to be mortgaged home owners - in many places <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/why-its-more-difficult-for-young-people-to-buy-a-house-now-than-it-was-fifty-years-ago-12537254\">it&rsquo;s been nearly impossible</a> for first time buyers to get onto the housing ladder in the first place.</p>\n<p>As the British economy appears to destroy itself in reaction to the Conservative&rsquo;s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/23/kwarteng-accused-of-reckless-mini-budget-for-the-rich-as-pound-crashes\">bewildering and reckless mini-budget</a>, the Bank of England has felt compelled to raise interest rates. This has many consequences, but of note here is the fact that many mortgages are directly linked to the BoE interest rate. Those that aren&rsquo;t are likely influenced by it, at least at the time of taking out the loan.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/the-interest-rate-bank-rate\">Bank of England&rsquo;s web page</a> shows how the interest rate has changed over the past decade.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/d16be7e3ad.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s been very low, under than 1% for most of the decade, but has already shot up to more than double that figure recently. But that&rsquo;s not where it&rsquo;s likely to stop.  The markets are apparently pricing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england\">an expected rate of 6%</a> for next year.</p>\n<p>This certainly isn&rsquo;t historically unprecedented - the rate was last 6% back in 1999, and it was more than double that a decade before. But people have obviously been taking out mortgages - and companies have been offering them - based on the situation in contemporary times rather than the state of the world 20 years ago. Even if a consumer  did proactively try and integrate future interest rate considerations into their mortgage decision they wouldn&rsquo;t have been saved; just a few months ago the projected interest rate for next year was just a quarter of what it seems like it may turn out to be.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/22/what-does-the-banks-interest-rate-hike-mean-for-peoples-financesr\">about 2.2 million people on variable rate mortgages</a>, who are likely to be affected in the short term. About 3 times as many people currently hold fixed rate mortgages so are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the short term, but as soon as they come to the end of their fixed rate - usually 2 or 5 years after they took the mortgage out -  they will end up in the same disaster-laden boat.</p>\n<p>The consequential differences in the monthly payments homeowners will be required to make are not small! Unfortunately a rise of 1 percentage point in the bank rate doesn&rsquo;t mean your payments get 1% larger. For mortgages that follow the Bank of England rate, the interest rate relates to that of your debt. I&rsquo;m sure many of us have been schooled about the miracle of compound interest when it comes to savings.

				"content_text": "Mortgage payments look to be one of the next crises the UK is going to have to stare into the existential void of, or do something about. \r\n\r\nNot content with folk being unable to afford food to eat or energy to heat, it seems like housing may be the next to go. Even for those people who are rich or lucky enough to be mortgaged home owners - in many places [it's been nearly impossible](https://news.sky.com/story/why-its-more-difficult-for-young-people-to-buy-a-house-now-than-it-was-fifty-years-ago-12537254) for first time buyers to get onto the housing ladder in the first place.\r\n\r\nAs the British economy appears to destroy itself in reaction to the Conservative's recent [bewildering and reckless mini-budget](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/23/kwarteng-accused-of-reckless-mini-budget-for-the-rich-as-pound-crashes), the Bank of England has felt compelled to raise interest rates. This has many consequences, but of note here is the fact that many mortgages are directly linked to the BoE interest rate. Those that aren't are likely influenced by it, at least at the time of taking out the loan.\r\n\r\nThe [Bank of England's web page](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/the-interest-rate-bank-rate) shows how the interest rate has changed over the past decade.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/d16be7e3ad.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nSo it's been very low, under than 1% for most of the decade, but has already shot up to more than double that figure recently. But that's not where it's likely to stop.  The markets are apparently pricing in [an expected rate of 6%](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england) for next year. \r\n\r\nThis certainly isn't historically unprecedented - the rate was last 6% back in 1999, and it was more than double that a decade before. But people have obviously been taking out mortgages - and companies have been offering them - based on the situation in contemporary times rather than the state of the world 20 years ago. Even if a consumer  did proactively try and integrate future interest rate considerations into their mortgage decision they wouldn't have been saved; just a few months ago the projected interest rate for next year was just a quarter of what it seems like it may turn out to be.\r\n\r\nThere are [about 2.2 million people on variable rate mortgages](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/22/what-does-the-banks-interest-rate-hike-mean-for-peoples-financesr), who are likely to be affected in the short term. About 3 times as many people currently hold fixed rate mortgages so are \"safe\" in the short term, but as soon as they come to the end of their fixed rate - usually 2 or 5 years after they took the mortgage out -  they will end up in the same disaster-laden boat.\r\n\r\nThe consequential differences in the monthly payments homeowners will be required to make are not small! Unfortunately a rise of 1 percentage point in the bank rate doesn't mean your payments get 1% larger. For mortgages that follow the Bank of England rate, the interest rate relates to that of your debt. I'm sure many of us have been schooled about the miracle of compound interest when it comes to savings. Unfortunately the same applies to debt.\r\n\r\nVarious articles have given some example calculations. A tweet from economist Samuel Tombs calculated that the average household looking to refinance a 2 year fix next year would need to find ¬£627 extra a month.\r\n\r\n{{< tweet user=\"samueltombs\" id=\"1574429056593977344\" >}}\r\n\r\nOthers examples quoted by [Yahoo Finance](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/sinking-pound-sterling-mortgage-debt-interest-rates-123320628.html) include someone with a ¬£140k mortgage that went from 2.25% to 6% would need to pay an additional ¬£270 a month. \r\n\r\nYou can choose your own example using one of the many mortgage calculators, such as the [one from MoneySavingExpert](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator/). \r\n\r\nWith that for example you can see that  you'd taken out ¬£150k over 25 years at say 1.5%, that's a monthly payment of ¬£600.

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Plastic in our environment is not litter. It is a pollutant from fast business serving society in the wrong way while outsourcing the cost to Mother Nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/d10b5a16cd.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"320\" alt=\"\" />\n<p><em>(My book notes aim to summarise the parts of the book that most attracted my attention, perhaps reworded or reorganised, and don‚Äôt necessarily reflect whether I agree or disagree with them. I‚Äôm very open to discussions as to whether I&rsquo;ve missed or misunderstood anything).</em></p>\n<p>Since the 1950s we&rsquo;ve produced 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic.  Most of it is still with us. By 2015, 9% has been recycled, 12% incinerated, 79% in landfills/environment.</p>\n<p>We produce 320 million metric tonnes of new plastic each year, almost all from oil. 8 million tonnes of this leak into oceans and waterways. By 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic than fish, by weight.</p>\n<p>Some plastics are truly useful, e.g. polymers used for heart valves and bulletproof vests. We should fight against avoidable useless plastic being forced upon us.</p>\n<p>Stopping the environmental disaster will require radical action. To be sustainable we must leave the earth in the same or better shape for the next generation.</p>\n<p>Plastic is a fossil fuel product. 90% of the plastic we consume is virgin plastic made of oil. 8% of the barrels of oil we extract from the earth becomes plastic.</p>\n<p>The world&rsquo;s most common plastic is polyethylene, which is used to make e.g. bottles and containers.</p>\n<p>Plastic packing is increasingly used for food because it was cost-effective and made it easier for retailers and manufacturers to extend the shelf life of food. They argued it made food cheaper for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-age-of-plastic\">The age of plastic</h2>\n<p>The &ldquo;shifting baseline&rdquo; is a green movement concept whereby each generation treats the state of the world in their youth as the baseline to compare changes to.  Over time this lowers society&rsquo;s expectations and ambitions around protecting the environment.</p>\n<p>The first plastic in the world was known as &ldquo;Parkesine&rdquo;, after it&rsquo;s inventor Alexander Parks.\nIt&rsquo;s initial market was as a substitute for various &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; products previously obtained killing animals in the garment industry, such as the &ldquo;tortoiseshell&rdquo; obtained from hawksbill sea turtles. In this way it may have had an environmentally friendly impact - saving the hawksbills from extinction.</p>\n<p>Following its invention, it was felt humans no longer had to be dictated to by nature.</p>\n<p>The commercialization took off from the 1950s; within a decade 20 million plastic bags were being produced in the UK. The culture of make-do-or-mend went away. Marketers loved that consumers tended to buy more when it was wrapped in a bubble or tamper free pack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-wake-up-call\">A wake up call</h2>\n<p>The Blue Planet II documentary focussed the nation&rsquo;s attention on plastic pollution. The social media and press outcry following it translated in a 25 Year Environment Plan from the UK government in 2018, which included a commitment to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years. A few businesses joined the effort, but not the big retailers beholden to shareholders.</p>\n<p>Recycling can be effective -  recycling plastic reduces energy and resource use, harmful emissions and reduces landfill. But in the UK there is confusion over what actually happens to the rubbish we put in our recycling bins.</p>\n<p>The landfill tax is current ¬£88.95 per tonne of general waste, and we have got better at recycling - about middle of the table vs the rest of Europe.</p>\n<p>But many of the plastics that are sent to Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) have low recycling rates. One estimate is only 10-15% of mixed plastics are recycled. They also can&rsquo;t keep pace with the amount of rubbish despite their expansion; we get through 5 million tonnes of plastic packaging a year in the UK vs having a capacity to recycle only 350,000 tonnes.</p>\n<p>Waste giants need profit to satisfy their shareholders which is hard when the value of recyclate is low.</p>\n<p>2 types of recycling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Closed-loop recycling: the old material is returned to an &ldquo;as new&rdquo; state ready to be made into a product of the same material. The material holds its value and can be repeatedly recycled. We don&rsquo;t have enough of this.</li>\n<li>Open-loop recycling: the material is recycled into a different material, e.g. a plastic bottle processed to form recyclate flakes for use in fibre manufacturing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain plastics aren&rsquo;t rated highly on the global recycling market or are difficult to process. They&rsquo;re often burned to produce electricity. Since 2008 legislation, incinerators are allowed to be described as &ldquo;recovery facilities&rdquo;. But once burned the plastic is lost, so it&rsquo;s wasteful. Burning also releases emissions into the environment.</p>\n<p>We export a lot of materials for recycling, 2.7 million tonnes to China/Hong Kong between 2012-2018. But in 2017 China clamped down and would only accept the cleanest materials. This led to UK local authorities reducing the types of materials they&rsquo;d accept, whilst they look for other markets that don&rsquo;t care about the quality of their waste imports.</p>\n<p>Until 2016 the UK had a statutory plastic packaging recycling target of 57%.  That&rsquo;s since been reduced to 49%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-how-plastic-flows-into-and-around-the-environment\">Understanding how plastic flows into and around the environment</h2>\n<p>The impact of the individual litter lout is often exaggerated, which lets the big culprits off.</p>\n<p>Litter-louts do exist - men drop 3x as much litter as women, and 16-24 year olds drop twice as much as other age groups.</p>\n<p>Education and surveillance have been proposed as the solution to littering. But studies suggest education isn&rsquo;t the real issue. Rather, funding cuts to local government have reduced street cleaning and sweeping, leaving litter. Manufacturers of single-use packaging have not been tackled, despite the fact that the 500% increase in litter since the 1960s mirrors the growth of the packaging industry.</p>\n<p>We should prioritise reducing the sources of plastic. It&rsquo;s hard to deal with the 8-12 million tonnes of plastic waste once its already in the marine environment, 80% of which originates from the land,  e.g. from overflowing bins.</p>\n<p>One trash enters the ocean it settles into islands. There&rsquo;s a huge whirlpool of trash known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP), coverung 600,000 square miles of ocean, bigger than France or Texas. It weighs 79,000 tonnes, has 1.8 trillion pieces of rubbish, almost all plastic. Some from 40 years ago has been found.</p>\n<p>In water, macro plastics are tossed up against abrasive objects and broken down by UV rays until they become microplastics, a great risk to marine life.</p>\n<p>Now we wear clothes made from synthetic man-made fibres, washing releases plastic microfibres into the environment - potentially 700k+ per machine wash.</p>\n<p>Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) like DDT can adhere to microplastics. On land we have tried to phase POPs out, but now they can enter the food chain through via microplastics.</p>\n<p>The average European seafood eater eats an estimated 11,000 pieces of microplastic a year. 83% of drinking water samples are contaminated. They&rsquo;ve been found in salt, beer and honey.</p>\n<p>A 4 cent charge on carrier bags that was introduced in Greece in 2018 caused usage to drop by 80% in the first month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-plastic-footprint\">Our plastic footprint</h2>\n<p>Most of the 8 million pieces of waste that enter the world&rsquo;s marine environment every day are made of plastic. 70% of the rubbish sinks to the seabed, 15% drifts upwards in the water, and 15% is deposited on shores.</p>\n<p>British household consumption is the &ldquo;main engine of growth for the UK economy&rdquo;, representing 63% of GDP. But everything we consume depletes the earth&rsquo;s resources.</p>\n<p>Mathis Wackernagel created a model to account for &ldquo;ecological footprinting&rdquo;. Calculations showed that Western Europe consumers were using up resources faster than the planet could replenish them. If everyone consumed at UK rates we would need 3 planets worth of resources.</p>\n<p>The annual Earth Overshoot Day occurs on the day that we exceed the earth&rsquo;s capacity to regenerate life-sustaining resources. In 2017 it was on 2nd August. Each year it is a few days earlier.</p>\n<p>The UK&rsquo;s plastic footprint is 139-140kg per person per year - 3x the consumption rate in 1980.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re 5th in the EU in terms of consumption single-use plastics.  We&rsquo;d be top 2 if it wasn&rsquo;t for the smoking ban, cigarette advertising regulations and education reducing the number of smokers - cigarette butts contain plastic.</p>\n<p>67% of discarded plastic is packaging. ~40% of plastic in bins could be recycled, but the real rate is lower.</p>\n<p>The toy industry is the most plastic-intensive, using 40 tonnes of plastic for every $1 million revenue.</p>\n<p>Corporations often do not wish to share plastic consumption numbers. It&rsquo;s important that they do, not to name and shame, but rather to help understand what we need to do next.</p>\n<p>Bans on certain plastic items (e.g. plastic straws) can be helpful, but tackle only that 1 item. Something else will take its place unless we change the culture and reduce the attractiveness of disposable products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-toolbox-to-reduce-your-plastic-footprint\">A toolbox to reduce your plastic footprint</h2>\n<p>The Mobius Loop has been adopted as an internationally recognised symbol of recycling, often alongside the slogan &ldquo;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>But it was harder to recycle than we thought. The recycling symbol can be found on products like single-used coffee-cups where fewer than 0.1% are actually successfully recycled. A local authority accepting an item doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;ll actually be recycled.</p>\n<p>The mobius strip with inverted colours (white on black) means the item was made with recycled material and can be recycled again, but this is rare</p>\n<p>Industry introduced a more nuanced, label system. Items are either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Widely recycled: collected by at least 65% of councils.</li>\n<li>Check local recycling: collected by 15-65% of councils</li>\n<li>Not currently recycled: collected by &lt;15% of councils.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flat arrows with a number 1-7 tell you what type of polymer is in the product, not whether it&rsquo;s recyclable.</p>\n<p>Globally 15% of plastic waste is recycled, but only 5% of that is turned into a recycled object or material.</p>\n<p>We must add more &ldquo;R&rdquo; strategies to the toolbox:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#record\">Record</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#reduce\">Reduce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#replace\">Replace</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#refuse\">Refuse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#reuse\">Reuse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#refill\">Refill</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#rethink\">Rethink</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#recycle\">Recycle</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"record\">Record</h3>\n<p>Keep a diary of every single piece of plastic that enters your life for 4 weeks (or at least 2). Include plastic both inside and outside the home.</p>\n<p>The author provides an example grid containg columns for source, whether it&rsquo;s avoidable, whether it&rsquo;s single-use, where it ends up, whether you wanted it, its features and more.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s likely that a couple would record between 300-1000 items, much more for larger families.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reduce\">Reduce</h3>\n<p>Telling someone they need to reduce plastic packaging unhelpful, in the same way that just  telling someone to stop smoking or eat less to lose weight is.</p>\n<p>The plastic diary is similar to a food diary, and those have been shown effective for weight loss.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single use plastics: Separate the behaviour from the product. Instead of a single-use takeaway coffee cup, sit down and drink it in the cafe from a china cup</li>\n<li>Fizzy drinks: Half of the 35 million plastic bottles bought in the UK each day aren&rsquo;t recycled. Consider limiting intake for health reasons. By canned drinks if you want some.</li>\n<li>Plastic straws: Straws are rarely actually necessary at all.</li>\n<li>Online shopping: Sometimes you can select a no bag option. Others rely on recycling carrier bags. Ticking Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Frustration Free&rdquo; packaging option will lower the plastic they send you. More than150 people per day in Britain stab themselves trying to open packaged products. Treating packaging injuries from e.g. moulded vacuum-sealed plastic packaging film costs the NHS ¬£11 million a year.</li>\n<li>Buy less stuff.</li>\n<li>Declutter: The average American home contains more than 300,000 items.</li>\n<li>Takeaway and fast-food packaging. Online services sometimes let you opt-out of receiving single-use plastic items like cutlery.

It may also save you money. This works well for household cleaning products, laundry products and store-cupboard staples like grains, flour, oils , rice, flour, pasta, soup mixes, beans, cereals, nut butters, sugars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, snacks and treats, loose tea and coffee, herbs, spices, salts and peppercorns.</li>\n<li>Find your nearest health food or natural store that provides a refill service.</li>\n<li>Or use concentrated forms of household cleaning products such as soaps, laundry liquids, detergents.

It went from recycling 5% of waste 20 years ago to be on target to achieve 70% by 2025.</p>\n<p>Targets and goals are important. Wales established statutory targets and most LAs provided kerbside recycling docks where residents sort they recycling at home into boxes based on type and then put into the relevant dock.</p>\n<p>Using one &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; recycling bag instead is worse because you end up with lower quality recyclate, which is harder to sell into the global market.

				"content_text": "> Plastic in our environment is not litter. It is a pollutant from fast business serving society in the wrong way while outsourcing the cost to Mother Nature.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/d10b5a16cd.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"320\" alt=\"\" />\n\n_(My book notes aim to summarise the parts of the book that most attracted my attention, perhaps reworded or reorganised, and don‚Äôt necessarily reflect whether I agree or disagree with them. I‚Äôm very open to discussions as to whether I've missed or misunderstood anything)._\n\nSince the 1950s we've produced 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic.  Most of it is still with us. By 2015, 9% has been recycled, 12% incinerated, 79% in landfills/environment.\n\nWe produce 320 million metric tonnes of new plastic each year, almost all from oil. 8 million tonnes of this leak into oceans and waterways. By 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic than fish, by weight.\n\nSome plastics are truly useful, e.g. polymers used for heart valves and bulletproof vests. We should fight against avoidable useless plastic being forced upon us.\n\nStopping the environmental disaster will require radical action. To be sustainable we must leave the earth in the same or better shape for the next generation.\n\nPlastic is a fossil fuel product. 90% of the plastic we consume is virgin plastic made of oil. 8% of the barrels of oil we extract from the earth becomes plastic.\n\nThe world's most common plastic is polyethylene, which is used to make e.g. bottles and containers.\n\nPlastic packing is increasingly used for food because it was cost-effective and made it easier for retailers and manufacturers to extend the shelf life of food. They argued it made food cheaper for everyone. \n\n## The age of plastic\n\nThe \"shifting baseline\" is a green movement concept whereby each generation treats the state of the world in their youth as the baseline to compare changes to.  Over time this lowers society's expectations and ambitions around protecting the environment.\n\nThe first plastic in the world was known as \"Parkesine\", after it's inventor Alexander Parks. \nIt's initial market was as a substitute for various \"traditional\" products previously obtained killing animals in the garment industry, such as the \"tortoiseshell\" obtained from hawksbill sea turtles. In this way it may have had an environmentally friendly impact - saving the hawksbills from extinction.\n\nFollowing its invention, it was felt humans no longer had to be dictated to by nature.\n\nThe commercialization took off from the 1950s; within a decade 20 million plastic bags were being produced in the UK. The culture of make-do-or-mend went away. Marketers loved that consumers tended to buy more when it was wrapped in a bubble or tamper free pack.\n\n## A wake up call\n\nThe Blue Planet II documentary focussed the nation's attention on plastic pollution. The social media and press outcry following it translated in a 25 Year Environment Plan from the UK government in 2018, which included a commitment to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years. A few businesses joined the effort, but not the big retailers beholden to shareholders.\n\nRecycling can be effective -  recycling plastic reduces energy and resource use, harmful emissions and reduces landfill. But in the UK there is confusion over what actually happens to the rubbish we put in our recycling bins.\n\nThe landfill tax is current ¬£88.95 per tonne of general waste, and we have got better at recycling - about middle of the table vs the rest of Europe.\n\nBut many of the plastics that are sent to Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) have low recycling rates. One estimate is only 10-15% of mixed plastics are recycled. They also can't keep pace with the amount of rubbish despite their expansion; we get through 5 million tonnes of plastic packaging a year in the UK vs having a capacity to recycle only 350,000 tonnes.\n\nWaste giants need profit to satisfy their shareholders which is hard when the value of recyclate is low.\n\n2 types of recycling:\n\n- Closed-loop recycling: the old material is returned to an \"as new\" state ready to be made into a product of the same material. The material holds its value and can be repeatedly recycled. We don't have enough of this.\n- Open-loop recycling: the material is recycled into a different material, e.g. a plastic bottle processed to form recyclate flakes for use in fibre manufacturing.\n\nCertain plastics aren't rated highly on the global recycling market or are difficult to process. They're often burned to produce electricity. Since 2008 legislation, incinerators are allowed to be described as \"recovery facilities\". But once burned the plastic is lost, so it's wasteful. Burning also releases emissions into the environment.\n\nWe export a lot of materials for recycling, 2.7 million tonnes to China/Hong Kong between 2012-2018. But in 2017 China clamped down and would only accept the cleanest materials. This led to UK local authorities reducing the types of materials they'd accept, whilst they look for other markets that don't care about the quality of their waste imports.\n\nUntil 2016 the UK had a statutory plastic packaging recycling target of 57%.  That's since been reduced to 49%.\n\n## Understanding how plastic flows into and around the environment\n\nThe impact of the individual litter lout is often exaggerated, which lets the big culprits off.\n\nLitter-louts do exist - men drop 3x as much litter as women, and 16-24 year olds drop twice as much as other age groups. \n\nEducation and surveillance have been proposed as the solution to littering. But studies suggest education isn't the real issue. Rather, funding cuts to local government have reduced street cleaning and sweeping, leaving litter. Manufacturers of single-use packaging have not been tackled, despite the fact that the 500% increase in litter since the 1960s mirrors the growth of the packaging industry.\n\nWe should prioritise reducing the sources of plastic. It's hard to deal with the 8-12 million tonnes of plastic waste once its already in the marine environment, 80% of which originates from the land,  e.g. from overflowing bins.\n\nOne trash enters the ocean it settles into islands. There's a huge whirlpool of trash known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP), coverung 600,000 square miles of ocean, bigger than France or Texas. It weighs 79,000 tonnes, has 1.8 trillion pieces of rubbish, almost all plastic. Some from 40 years ago has been found.\n\nIn water, macro plastics are tossed up against abrasive objects and broken down by UV rays until they become microplastics, a great risk to marine life.\n\nNow we wear clothes made from synthetic man-made fibres, washing releases plastic microfibres into the environment - potentially 700k+ per machine wash.\n\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) like DDT can adhere to microplastics. On land we have tried to phase POPs out, but now they can enter the food chain through via microplastics.\n\nThe average European seafood eater eats an estimated 11,000 pieces of microplastic a year. 83% of drinking water samples are contaminated. They've been found in salt, beer and honey.\n\nA 4 cent charge on carrier bags that was introduced in Greece in 2018 caused usage to drop by 80% in the first month.\n\n## Our plastic footprint\n\nMost of the 8 million pieces of waste that enter the world's marine environment every day are made of plastic. 70% of the rubbish sinks to the seabed, 15% drifts upwards in the water, and 15% is deposited on shores.\n\nBritish household consumption is the \"main engine of growth for the UK economy\", representing 63% of GDP. But everything we consume depletes the earth's resources.\n\nMathis Wackernagel created a model to account for \"ecological footprinting\". Calculations showed that Western Europe consumers were using up resources faster than the planet could replenish them. If everyone consumed at UK rates we would need 3 planets worth of resources.\n\nThe annual Earth Overshoot Day occurs on the day that we exceed the earth's capacity to regenerate life-sustaining resources. In 2017 it was on 2nd August. Each year it is a few days earlier.\n\nThe UK's plastic footprint is 139-140kg per person per year - 3x the consumption rate in 1980.\n\nWe're 5th in the EU in terms of consumption single-use plastics.  We'd be top 2 if it wasn't for the smoking ban, cigarette advertising regulations and education reducing the number of smokers - cigarette butts contain plastic.\n\n67% of discarded plastic is packaging. ~40% of plastic in bins could be recycled, but the real rate is lower.\n\nThe toy industry is the most plastic-intensive, using 40 tonnes of plastic for every $1 million revenue.\n\nCorporations often do not wish to share plastic consumption numbers. It's important that they do, not to name and shame, but rather to help understand what we need to do next.\n\nBans on certain plastic items (e.g. plastic straws) can be helpful, but tackle only that 1 item. Something else will take its place unless we change the culture and reduce the attractiveness of disposable products.\n\n## A toolbox to reduce your plastic footprint\n\nThe Mobius Loop has been adopted as an internationally recognised symbol of recycling, often alongside the slogan \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\".\n\nBut it was harder to recycle than we thought. The recycling symbol can be found on products like single-used coffee-cups where fewer than 0.1% are actually successfully recycled. A local authority accepting an item doesn't mean it'll actually be recycled.\n\nThe mobius strip with inverted colours (white on black) means the item was made with recycled material and can be recycled again, but this is rare\n\nIndustry introduced a more nuanced, label system. Items are either:\n- Widely recycled: collected by at least 65% of councils.\n- Check local recycling: collected by 15-65% of councils\n- Not currently recycled: collected by <15% of councils.\n\nFlat arrows with a number 1-7 tell you what type of polymer is in the product, not whether it's recyclable. \n\nGlobally 15% of plastic waste is recycled, but only 5% of that is turned into a recycled object or material.\n\nWe must add more \"R\" strategies to the toolbox:\n\n1. [Record](#record)\n2. [Reduce](#reduce)\n3. [Replace](#replace)\n4. [Refuse](#refuse)\n5. [Reuse](#reuse)\n6. [Refill](#refill)\n7. [Rethink](#rethink)\n8. [Recycle](#recycle)\n\n### Record\n\nKeep a diary of every single piece of plastic that enters your life for 4 weeks (or at least 2). Include plastic both inside and outside the home.\n\nThe author provides an example grid containg columns for source, whether it's avoidable, whether it's single-use, where it ends up, whether you wanted it, its features and more.\n\nIt's likely that a couple would record between 300-1000 items, much more for larger families.\n\n### Reduce\n\nTelling someone they need to reduce plastic packaging unhelpful, in the same way that just  telling someone to stop smoking or eat less to lose weight is.\n\nThe plastic diary is similar to a food diary, and those have been shown effective for weight loss.\n\n- Single use plastics: Separate the behaviour from the product. Instead of a single-use takeaway coffee cup, sit down and drink it in the cafe from a china cup \n- Fizzy drinks: Half of the 35 million plastic bottles bought in the UK each day aren't recycled. Consider limiting intake for health reasons. By canned drinks if you want some.\n- Plastic straws: Straws are rarely actually necessary at all.\n- Online shopping: Sometimes you can select a no bag option. Others rely on recycling carrier bags. Ticking Amazon's \"Frustration Free\" packaging option will lower the plastic they send you. More than150 people per day in Britain stab themselves trying to open packaged products. Treating packaging injuries from e.g. moulded vacuum-sealed plastic packaging film costs the NHS ¬£11 million a year.\n- Buy less stuff.\n- Declutter: The average American home contains more than 300,000 items.\n- Takeaway and fast-food packaging. Online services sometimes let you opt-out of receiving single-use plastic items like cutlery. They may let you bring your own containers.\n\n#### Food packaging\nSupermarkets distribute 800k tonnes of plastic packaging a year.\n\n- Try local greengrocers and butchers if possible, many let you use your own containers.\n- Buy loose veg.\n- Otherwise there's often paper bags near the mushrooms you can use instead of the plastic ones.\n- Avoid anything wrapped in thin plastic film, it's recycling rate is 3%.\n- Choose simple foods - they tend to have less complex packaging.\n- Buy in bulk.\n- Grow your own food if you can - you only need a little space to grow e.g. salad leaves or strawberries.\n- Cut down on snacks (this may also have health benefits). Or some ethical snack brands e.g. Divine Chocolate deliberately don't use plastic. Most others use polypropylene packaging.\n- Cook from scratch.\n- Eat less meat.\n- Buy from the fish, bakery and butchery counters, taking your own containers.\n- Consider changing which store you go to to one that's proactive in the anti-plastic fight.\n\n### Replace\n\nSome stores now opened in the UK where you can bulk-buy and refill.\n\nReplace things at the right time. Everything has a break-even point where the amount of resources that went into making it are offset by how often it's used. It doesn't make sense to throw away plastic you have that can still be used.\n\nReuse, refill or recycle empty bottles and containers.\n\nThe online plastic-free community can advise further.\n\n- Switch to glass milk bottles.\n- Buy a SodaStream if you drink fizzy drinks.\n- Switch to glass containers. 80% of glass is recycled. It's non toxic, but not always good for bathroom products.\n- Use Tupperware.\n- Switch to laundry soap nuts.\n- Use non-plastic toothbrushes (e.g. bamboo).\n- Refuse microbeads! In the UK rinse-off products containing microbeads were banned in 2018, so only older products should have them.  \"Leave-on\" products e.g. sun creams, lipsticks, moisturisers may still contain microplastics.\n- Switch to soap bars.\n- The \"Go naked!\" range in Lush is plastic-free.\n- Use cloth nappies. Over time they're cheaper than disposables and \"nappy libraries\" may help with the cost.  Even biodegradable disposables will last 100s of years in landfill. \n- Switch to cardboard toys - Nintendo's Labo range is popular.\n\n### Refuse\nThe 2015 5p levy on plastic bags should increase our confidence to refuse plastic in other forms.\n\n- Refuse receipts (they're coated in a plastic additive), plastic bags, wrapping or single-use cutlery where possible.\n- Avoid badly designed products that end up in landfill, e.g. standup pouches with a valve and disposable toothbrushes with batteries.\n- Write letters or tweet at companies with particularly poor examples of packaging. If they have a plastic reduction policy point out the discrepancy.\n- Register with the Mail Preference Service to reduce unsolicited mail often wrapped in plastic or on plasticised paper.\n- Use the law - the Packaging Essential Requirements Regulations bans packaging beyond what's needed for safety, hygiene and acceptance for the product by the consumer. Report infractions to the local Trading Standards Officer. A sample letter is available from [Jo Swinson](http://www.joswinson.org.uk/excess_packaging). Throwing plastic plastic waste from your car is a finable offence.\n\nSome protest groups have unwrapped their shopping in-store to highlight the issue. If you do this: be sure to pay for all the goods, pick up the packaging afterwards, take reusable containers to transfer products into and be aware of e.g. littering laws.\n\n### Reuse\n\nWhen you buy something involving plastic, consider whether the packaging can be re-used. Clear plastic products are an obvious case that can.   \n\n- Reuse a water-bottle several times. The toxic chemicals people worry about are not found in PET, which is 99.9% of bottled water.\n- Don't assume that anything is dishwasher safer.\n- Plastic ready-meal tubs, trays and pots are generally not worth recycling as they're low quality - reuse them.\n- Reuse cleaning product sprays and trigger nozzles as long as they don't contain dangerous ingredients. Fill with your own cleaner e.g. white wine vinegar.\n- Take reusable cutlery wherever you go.\n- Plastic toys are made to last, don't dump them. Although you may need to be careful about certain old toys created before prior to plastic safety legislation.\n\nSome brands are getting worse - e.g. the big feminine care brands have switched from cardboard to plastic tampon applicators. Consider switching to reusable menstruation products like the Mooncup.\n\n### Refill\n\nA report found that 29% of millennials said they don't use refillable water bottles because they are too heavy. A generation before, mandatory deposit schemes for bottles and refillable containers were common. Soft drink manufacturers such as Coca Coal and Pepsi successfully lobbied against them.\n\n- Get a refillable coffee cup. The 2.5 billion disposable ones used in the UK each year are very difficult to recycle as they're infused with plastic. Only 1 in 400 is recycled.\n- Get a refillable water bottle. \n\t- [Refill.org.uk](https://refill.org.uk) will show you places that are happy to refill your bottle, although in practice most restaurants and cafes will do so.\n\t- UK tap water has the highest treatment standards in the world, higher than bottled water, but if you still don't like it then you can refill from a filter jug like a Brita or use a refillable bottle that comes with a filter (e.g. Bobble).\n- Get a juicer if you drink a lot of fruit juice.\n- Buying in bulk or getting refills for re-usable containers is preferable to just choosing a brand that uses biocompostable plastic. It may also save you money. This works well for household cleaning products, laundry products and store-cupboard staples like grains, flour, oils , rice, flour, pasta, soup mixes, beans, cereals, nut butters, sugars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, snacks and treats, loose tea and coffee, herbs, spices, salts and peppercorns.\n- Find your nearest health food or natural store that provides a refill service. \n- Or use concentrated forms of household cleaning products such as soaps, laundry liquids, detergents. These come as a small sachet that you mix with water and put in a reusable cleaning bottle. [Spolsh.com](https://splosh.com/) sells some.\n- Some new businesses only stock unpackaged goods - e.g. independent health food and organic shops. Some online retailers are beginning to do this, e.g. Zero Waste Club.\n\n### Rethink\n\nWe must rethink some of our habits. That includes when outside of our homes or around special occasions.\n\nLook out for hidden plastics: wet wipes, coffee cups, chewing gum, most aluminium cans, teabags.\n\n- Put 2 small bins in your bathroom, one for recyclables (loo roll tubes, empty bottles and tubs etc.), the other for non-recyclables (wipes and cotton buds, contact lenses etc.) \n- Only flush toilet paper.\n- Don't use wet wipes. They contain plastic polymers.\n- Use a traditional flannel.\n- Buy fully compostable teabags (most mainstream ones use a plastic sealant, polypropylene).\n- Check garment labels, and opt for natural fibres like wool, cotton, hemp and linen to avoid microplastics being released when washed.\n- Lobby the airlines to reduce plastic.\n- Use a \"bucket and spade library\" when on holiday.\n- Throw plastic-free parties.\n- Don't use  plastic cups, throwaway glasses, \"paper\" plates and cups. They're are usually coated in plastic.\n- Only use paper straws\n- If you must use balloons, make sure to never release them into the sky, pop them when done - even if they're \"biodegradable\".\n- Replace glitter with \"Eco glitter\".\n- Use sustainable gift wrap - most papers are coated in plastic.\n- Switch to Easter eggs packaged in cardboard or tins.\n- Support plastic-free festivals, sports matches, and other entertainment.\n\n### Recycle\n\nUnlike the rest of the UK, Wales is a recycling success story. It went from recycling 5% of waste 20 years ago to be on target to achieve 70% by 2025. \n\nTargets and goals are important. Wales established statutory targets and most LAs provided kerbside recycling docks where residents sort they recycling at home into boxes based on type and then put into the relevant dock. \n\nUsing one \"mixed\" recycling bag instead is worse because you end up with lower quality recyclate, which is harder to sell into the global market. The UK's recyclate is dropping in quality. \n\nHigher quality recyclate fetches higher prices and more markets will buy it. Whilst it's more arduous to sort it at home, this should eventually translate into lowered council tax and better public services.\n\n- Ask your local authority to change to a kerbside sort collection system.\n- Make sure everything you recycle is clean, dry and not contaminated with anything you're unsure about.\n- Rinse plastics.\n- Don't put one plastic inside another plastic container.\n- Put the lids on bottles. They're easy to separate at a MRF and less likely to escape into the environment if on.\n- There's no need to peel labels off plastics unless you're instructed to.\n- If it's a clear plastic bottle recycle it. If you're out then bring the bottle home to recycle rather than putting it in a public bin that doesn't do recycling.\n- Don't put anything with a battery or VHS tapes in recycling.\n- Don't recycle moulded plastic that's of an uncertain polymer, or those marked #3.\n- Use any recycling opportunities that companies and brands offer, e.g. Ocado pays 5p for each plastic bag you return. ASDA, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, the Co-op and Waitrose have collection points for bag. Tetra Park has collection points [in most towns](https://www.tetrapak.com/en-gb/sustainability/local-pages/where-can-i-recycle).\n- Buy recycled products - although this is hard as < 2% of items on the market contain plastic waste. \n- Visit the [TerraCycle website](https://www.terracycle.com/en-GB/) who can recycle a vast array of products no-one else can, although it can be expensive.\n\n## Structural changes\n\nIt's worth supporting bigger changes that will reduce plastic usage more than your own personal usage can. We need to be imaginiative.\n\n- Almost no manufacturers or retailers pay the true cost of cleaning up their cheap oil-based packaging. Demand a report like the Stern Review which reviewed the cost of climate change.\n- Introduce a bottle deposit system. The collection rate of plastic bottles in Norway and Sweden is 97%  It's been announced that England will do this, but no dates have been set. \n- Once used, chewing gum is flexible plastic. \"Gumdrops\" are plastic bins that can take 500 pieces of used gum. Once they're full the whole bin is collected and processed as one piece of plastic. One full bin makes 3 new bins.\n- Ellen MacArthur has produced a blueprint for transformation called the \"New Plastics Economy\", which at least 40 big brands have signed up to.\n- Some cafes and restaurants have compost collection schemes.- \n- Bioplastics that biodegrade in the earth have been developed, made of cellulose instead of hydrocarbons. We should keep researching this tech, but it may not end up as effective as hoped.\n\t- They look like normal plastics so often end up in standard recycling. \n\t- There isn't enough oxygen in a landfill site for them to biodegrade. \n\t- In the UK it's very rare that the temperature is high enough in people's compost piles to start the breakdown process.\n- Making products made of plastic waste seem desirable might transform our relationship with it. In fashion, it's possible to use yarn made from recovered plastics. Adidas have produced a collection of trainers made from ocean plastic.\n\n## Be an activist\n\nThere is a real chance we can end the plastic age.\n- All 193 UN member states have signed a resolution to eliminate plastic in the sea.\n- Every UK public body has a plastic reduction target.\n\nActivists were critical to creating this legislation. There are many ways to get involved.\n\nIn 2015, the Dutch government was successfully sued by citizens for knowingly contributing towards a breach of the target for global warming. For the first time, a court ordered the state to protect its citizens from climate change.\n\n- Look for campaigns that collect data on single-use plastic and toxins in the oceans, or those creating an online community of change-makers allied with global ambassadors. One group the author likes is [A Plastic Planet](https://aplasticplanet.com)\n- Don't underestimate petitions - 10 billion fewer plastic teabags per year exist because of one person's petition.\n- Sign the [OceanWise pledge](https://plasticreduction.ocean.org/individuals/)\n- Talk to everyone you meet in local shops and businesses.\n- Get involved in the [Plastic Free Communities](https://www.sas.org.uk/plastic-free-%20communities/) programme.\n\nConsider matching your activism to your personality. The [Happy Hero book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36386777-the-happy-hero) has a profiling section to help. There are many opportunities to help, from crafting a bag from recycled fabric though to adrenaline filled expeditions.\n",

				"title": "If Disney did ruin The Little Mermaid then it was 33 years ago",
				"content_html": "<p>Earlier this month Disney released a trailer for their upcoming film &ldquo;The Little Mermaid&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-wPm99PF9U\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>Of course it caused a certain amount of uproar on some of the less savoury parts of the internet (such as Youtube) based on the claim that Disney somehow ruined it by being &ldquo;too woke&rdquo;. As noted in a <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-little-mermaid\">recent edition</a> of <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/\">The Present Age&rsquo;s </a>newsletter, given the lack of dialogue or really anything other than swimming in the sea action, this basically means that people don&rsquo;t like the fact that a Black actress, Halle Bailey, was cast in the role of Ariel.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising, not least because the <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/halle-bailey-responds-to-little-mermaid-backlash-2019-8\">same rants and raves happened</a> upon the announcement of the casting 3 years ago, and the world doesn&rsquo;t seem to have improved much in that respect since then. I guess the people in question just forgot they&rsquo;d already made that particular angry attempt to cancel Disney.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the more glaring confirmations of what is going on here was when a Twitter user shared the results of &ldquo;using AI&rdquo; to <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-bans-weirdo-who-shared-racist-video-changing-halle-baileys-ariel-from-black-to-white/\">convert a still from the trailer</a> from featuring the original Halle Bailey to a fake white person, commenting that it was possible to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the entire movie like than in 24 hours. It is apparently, to quote the poster in question, &ldquo;over for wokecels.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trying to abstract the topic away from what is hard to read as anything other than simple racism,  I think Adam Serwer, in his Atlantic article &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/\">Fear of a Black Hobbit</a>&rdquo; is right in saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The demand to keep politics out of art is too often a demand for art to conform to conservative politics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To what extent does truly apolitical art exist? I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;can you make a film that isn&rsquo;t <em>about</em> politics?&rdquo; - of course you can. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine many films that aren&rsquo;t touched by society and politics one way or another.</p>\n<p>If what is really meant is &ldquo;I want films that resemble the ones that used to be made in my society 30 years ago&rdquo; then those films will naturally have been influenced the society and politics at the time. Nothing is born into a cultural vacuum. Even if one can find a story that can&rsquo;t be interpreted &ldquo;politically&rdquo; then there&rsquo;s still the considerations of who created the art, under what circumstances, why they chose that particular story, what their intent was with it and why they, as opposed to someone else, were the one to tell it.</p>\n<p>If one wants a specific example of this then we can look at the various ways that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_appearance_of_Jesus\">Jesus has been portrayed</a> over time. All sorts of skin colours have been used. Many detailed and vigorous debates have been had as to which is the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô one. And this is for an actual person for whom the consensus is that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus\">they likely did exist</a> as a historical figure - so there is an actual true answer to know in theory.</p>\n<p>On which note, the backlash to the The Little Mermaid&rsquo;s casting is a particularly wild and confusing phenomenon if taken at the surface level. For one, I&rsquo;m sorry if this traumatises anyone, but mermaids are mythical beings. We&rsquo;re not misrepresenting some fact of nature. How we choose to portray these folkloric beings is up to us.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the colour of Ariel&rsquo;s skin is totally irrelevant to the story. It&rsquo;s more about whether she has a fish tail or not.</p>\n<p>Where skin colour is a pivotal aspect to the story of course it often makes sense to preserve that in whichever way the story requires. Likewise if you‚Äôre trying to recreate an actual historical event as accurately as possible.

				"content_text": "Earlier this month Disney released a trailer for their upcoming film \"The Little Mermaid\".\n\n{{< youtube 0-wPm99PF9U >}}\n\nOf course it caused a certain amount of uproar on some of the less savoury parts of the internet (such as Youtube) based on the claim that Disney somehow ruined it by being \"too woke\". As noted in a [recent edition](https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-little-mermaid) of [The Present Age's ](https://www.readtpa.com/)newsletter, given the lack of dialogue or really anything other than swimming in the sea action, this basically means that people don't like the fact that a Black actress, Halle Bailey, was cast in the role of Ariel.\n\nThis isn't surprising, not least because the [same rants and raves happened](https://www.insider.com/halle-bailey-responds-to-little-mermaid-backlash-2019-8) upon the announcement of the casting 3 years ago, and the world doesn't seem to have improved much in that respect since then. I guess the people in question just forgot they'd already made that particular angry attempt to cancel Disney.\n\nPerhaps one of the more glaring confirmations of what is going on here was when a Twitter user shared the results of \"using AI\" to [convert a still from the trailer](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-bans-weirdo-who-shared-racist-video-changing-halle-baileys-ariel-from-black-to-white/) from featuring the original Halle Bailey to a fake white person, commenting that it was possible to \"fix\" the entire movie like than in 24 hours. It is apparently, to quote the poster in question, \"over for wokecels.\"\n\nTrying to abstract the topic away from what is hard to read as anything other than simple racism,  I think Adam Serwer, in his Atlantic article \"[Fear of a Black Hobbit](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/)\" is right in saying:\n\n> The demand to keep politics out of art is too often a demand for art to conform to conservative politics.\n\nTo what extent does truly apolitical art exist? I don't mean \"can you make a film that isn't *about* politics?\" - of course you can. But it's hard for me to imagine many films that aren't touched by society and politics one way or another. \n\nIf what is really meant is \"I want films that resemble the ones that used to be made in my society 30 years ago\" then those films will naturally have been influenced the society and politics at the time. Nothing is born into a cultural vacuum. Even if one can find a story that can't be interpreted \"politically\" then there's still the considerations of who created the art, under what circumstances, why they chose that particular story, what their intent was with it and why they, as opposed to someone else, were the one to tell it. \n\nIf one wants a specific example of this then we can look at the various ways that [Jesus has been portrayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_appearance_of_Jesus) over time. All sorts of skin colours have been used. Many detailed and vigorous debates have been had as to which is the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô one. And this is for an actual person for whom the consensus is that [they likely did exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus) as a historical figure - so there is an actual true answer to know in theory.\n\nOn which note, the backlash to the The Little Mermaid's casting is a particularly wild and confusing phenomenon if taken at the surface level. For one, I'm sorry if this traumatises anyone, but mermaids are mythical beings. We're not misrepresenting some fact of nature. How we choose to portray these folkloric beings is up to us.\n\nSecondly, the colour of Ariel's skin is totally irrelevant to the story. It's more about whether she has a fish tail or not. \n\nWhere skin colour is a pivotal aspect to the story of course it often makes sense to preserve that in whichever way the story requires. Likewise if you‚Äôre trying to recreate an actual historical event as accurately as possible. Switching the races of the actors in [BlackkKlansman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/) would be pretty nonsensical given its topic and basis in real life. The story of a fictional creature living in a fictional world where their salient experience is dependent on whether they have a fish tail or human legs does not have this limiting factor.\n\nIn reality, even a writer who wants to tell stories about race has many degrees of freedom. Science fiction for example contains many stories about social prejudice and discrimination paralleling racism but set in an entirely different looking and behaving world populated with distant aliens.  Experimenting with other identities can work similarly - Naomi Alderman's famous book \"[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power)\" explores a future where women become a physical threat to men, as opposed to the current world where the opposite is usually true. \n\nNext up, well, Black mermaids are nothing new even within the canon of Disney-specific Little Mermaid productions. Disney has had them for three decades. You've somewhat missed the boat on umm...\"proving\" they don't exist.\n\nIntroducing Gabriella, from 1992's Disney's Little Mermaid TV series:\n\n{{< figure src=\"/uploads/2022/65b44cb50a.png\" caption=\"Image from the [Mermaid Wiki](https://mermaid.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriella)\" >}}\n\nUnlike most Disney mermaids, Gabriella was actually based on a real person, albeit not one with a tail.  Her design was inspired by 2 year-old Gabriella Bommino who unfortunately died of leukaemia so young, but was already a Little Mermaid superfan.\n\nI don't if this choice caused any consternation in 1992 to be honest.

Many people have done so, years before last week's trailer came out.\n\nWhilst some may now find aspects of Disney's original 1989 film interpretation of The Little Mermaid [problematic](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-little-mermaid_b_1694342), the [Smithsonian Magazine wrote](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/little-mermaid-was-way-more-subversive-you-realized-180973464/) in some detail about the political subversion embedded within it at the time.\n\n>The last thing Americans would expect from Disney was a critique of patriarchy, but sure enough, Ashman‚Äôs¬†_The Little Mermaid_¬†is a gutsy film about gender and identity‚Äîa far cry from the staid Disney catalog.\n\nLenika Cruz [writing in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/the-little-mermaid-at-25-and-the-evolving-definition-of-strong-female/382581/) saw it as a \"stepping stone\" for Disney from a set of animations with few female leads (and those that did feature were often asleep for most of the film - think Snow White or Sleeping Beauty) to the more rounded, well-developed female cartoon stars of recent years.\n\nMore fundamentally, there has been many an interpretation of the original story, for example as an allegory for growing up, as a commentary on identity or a metaphor for gender relations.

That&rsquo;s not to say this style of monarchy <em>causes</em> these good outcomes, but it clearly doesn&rsquo;t prevent them, and perhaps may even be positively associated with them.</p>\n<p>Why do they appear to work well? Leslie argues that the unavoidable irrationality of bestowing power and finery upon someone predicated solely on who their parents are may be  part of the attraction - &ldquo;they speak to the heart as well as the head.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Humans are not purely rational beings, and perhaps the &ldquo;sentimental loyalty&rdquo; humans are prone to is better to be absorbed by a monarch than left to be picked up by the leader of a faction, with Atlee citing Hitler, Mussolini and de Gaulle as contenders. To the extent that a constitutional monarchy isn&rsquo;t the obvious centre of day-to-day power in practice, perhaps it&rsquo;s safer and more uniting to have irrational sentimentality directed that way.</p>\n<p>The fact that the queen didn&rsquo;t have to fight for votes in an election (or, to at least some extent popularity in the media) gave her the ability to not become part of any major argument. There are plenty of people who aren&rsquo;t a fan of the monarchy in principle, but nonetheless the queen did seem to be able to <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/sky-high-public-approval-for-the-queen-ahead-of-platinum-jubilee\">unite swathes of people</a> in a way that it&rsquo;s almost inconceivable a leader of a more &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; institution such as a political party could. This may be a particular property of some kings and queens more than others - after all support for Queen Elizabeth was substantially higher than the support for Britain remaining a monarchy at the same time -  but it almost by definition cannot be a property of anyone involved in a close-run battle for electoral success.</p>\n<p>The US of course famously has no monarch, having <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence\">torn themselves away</a> from the British one in 1776, but to many external observers seems to be riven by a particularly polarised politics. Certain presidential candidates appear to attract high amounts of almost conditionless blind-seeming loyalty from their supporters, as sentimental and irrational as anything one might feel for a monarch.</p>\n<p>Leslie also considers that the constitutional monarchy gives us a way to express positive sentiment for our fellow country-people. Not that we don&rsquo;t understand that they live an incredibly privileged and unusual live, and sometimes we may quite legitimately feel jealous or resentful of that. But at the end of the day we can acknowledge their common humanity. As a human family they proxy for all the country&rsquo;s families. The widespread doting over whoever the latest royal child is - who is after all just one of the hundreds of children born each day in the UK - being a reminder that we could and should feel love all those other children too.</p>\n",

Leslie argues that the unavoidable irrationality of bestowing power and finery upon someone predicated solely on who their parents are may be  part of the attraction - \"they speak to the heart as well as the head.\" \r\n\r\nHumans are not purely rational beings, and perhaps the \"sentimental loyalty\" humans are prone to is better to be absorbed by a monarch than left to be picked up by the leader of a faction, with Atlee citing Hitler, Mussolini and de Gaulle as contenders. To the extent that a constitutional monarchy isn't the obvious centre of day-to-day power in practice, perhaps it's safer and more uniting to have irrational sentimentality directed that way.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the queen didn't have to fight for votes in an election (or, to at least some extent popularity in the media) gave her the ability to not become part of any major argument. There are plenty of people who aren't a fan of the monarchy in principle, but nonetheless the queen did seem to be able to [unite swathes of people](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/sky-high-public-approval-for-the-queen-ahead-of-platinum-jubilee) in a way that it's almost inconceivable a leader of a more \"democratic\" institution such as a political party could. This may be a particular property of some kings and queens more than others - after all support for Queen Elizabeth was substantially higher than the support for Britain remaining a monarchy at the same time -  but it almost by definition cannot be a property of anyone involved in a close-run battle for electoral success.\r\n\r\nThe US of course famously has no monarch, having [torn themselves away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence) from the British one in 1776, but to many external observers seems to be riven by a particularly polarised politics. Certain presidential candidates appear to attract high amounts of almost conditionless blind-seeming loyalty from their supporters, as sentimental and irrational as anything one might feel for a monarch.\r\n\r\nLeslie also considers that the constitutional monarchy gives us a way to express positive sentiment for our fellow country-people. Not that we don't understand that they live an incredibly privileged and unusual live, and sometimes we may quite legitimately feel jealous or resentful of that. But at the end of the day we can acknowledge their common humanity. As a human family they proxy for all the country's families. The widespread doting over whoever the latest royal child is - who is after all just one of the hundreds of children born each day in the UK - being a reminder that we could and should feel love all those other children too.\n",

What surprised me a bit more was the support for some of the rather more authoritarian options.</p>\n<p>There was a net 23% support for &ldquo;a strongman who can ignore parliament&rdquo; as a good way to run the country in 18-34 year olds, vs a negative -42% in &gt; 55 year olds.  60% of the youngest group, 18-24 year olds thought it was a good idea.</p>\n<p>Even the rather radical &ldquo;put the army in charge&rdquo; only <em>just</em> got a negative support rating in younger cohorts - net disapproval of 8% in 18-34 year olds vs -74% in &gt;55 year olds.  44% of the 18-24 year olds were favourable towards  this type of rule.</p>\n<p>So is this a young person thing? Maybe despite being liberal in many other domains young folk always think strongman or army rule is a decent option? As well as not really making intuitive sense, it also isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/38e184282b.png\" width=\"545\" height=\"385\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>To be honest, I find the even the agreement level in the &ldquo;good years&rdquo; surprisingly high - and just look at the 2019 results! -  but clearly something changed such that the younger folks still think relying on a single strong leader is a good way forward.</p>\n<p>Likewise a pro army rule position has just gotten more and more popular over time, especially in younger cohorts.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/00c3dfb297.png\" width=\"538\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>Based on this admittedly fairly small time series, it doesn&rsquo;t look to be a general age effect.</p>\n<p>Some of the factors the report suggests are linked to this support for authoritarian rule include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Socio-economic circumstances, with the least secure 20% of voters being more than twice as likely as the most secure to say that democracy is a bad way to govern the country.</li>\n<li>Social connection, with people with more friends, or more diverse friend circles, being less likely to support authoritarian rule.</li>\n<li>Political leanings, with socially conservative young people being much more likely than liberal folk to support the strong man or army rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of that makes intuitive sense at least on the dislike of democracy side of things. If you live in a democracy and you have a particularly difficult life, why would you feel like it&rsquo;s a good way to run things?</p>\n<p>Thinking one form of rule is a good way to govern a country of course doesn&rsquo;t rule out also thinking others are. For example, young people who report generally trusting other people are both more likely to support democracy than those who don&rsquo;t, (81% vs 69%) but also more like to support strongman leaders (72% vs 51%). In fact a higher proportion of young people who say democracy is a good way to run the country also support the authoritarian methods of rule than those who don&rsquo;t. Perhaps some people just think that there <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a good way to run a country?</p>\n<p>The report authors believe that the drivers of general detachment that are leading to this and many other negative effects on young people can be summarised as being the narrowness of their social networks, overprotective parenting, the treadmill of modern work and the online culture.</p>\n",

What surprised me a bit more was the support for some of the rather more authoritarian options.\r\n\r\nThere was a net 23% support for \"a strongman who can ignore parliament\" as a good way to run the country in 18-34 year olds, vs a negative -42% in > 55 year olds.  60% of the youngest group, 18-24 year olds thought it was a good idea.\r\n\r\nEven the rather radical \"put the army in charge\" only *just* got a negative support rating in younger cohorts - net disapproval of 8% in 18-34 year olds vs -74% in >55 year olds.  44% of the 18-24 year olds were favourable towards  this type of rule.\r\n\r\nSo is this a young person thing? Maybe despite being liberal in many other domains young folk always think strongman or army rule is a decent option? As well as not really making intuitive sense, it also isn't the case.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/38e184282b.png\" width=\"545\" height=\"385\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I find the even the agreement level in the \"good years\" surprisingly high - and just look at the 2019 results! -  but clearly something changed such that the younger folks still think relying on a single strong leader is a good way forward.\r\n\r\nLikewise a pro army rule position has just gotten more and more popular over time, especially in younger cohorts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/00c3dfb297.png\" width=\"538\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nBased on this admittedly fairly small time series, it doesn't look to be a general age effect.\r\n\r\nSome of the factors the report suggests are linked to this support for authoritarian rule include:\r\n\r\n- Socio-economic circumstances, with the least secure 20% of voters being more than twice as likely as the most secure to say that democracy is a bad way to govern the country. \r\n- Social connection, with people with more friends, or more diverse friend circles, being less likely to support authoritarian rule.\r\n- Political leanings, with socially conservative young people being much more likely than liberal folk to support the strong man or army rule.\r\n\r\nA lot of that makes intuitive sense at least on the dislike of democracy side of things. If you live in a democracy and you have a particularly difficult life, why would you feel like it's a good way to run things?\r\n\r\nThinking one form of rule is a good way to govern a country of course doesn't rule out also thinking others are. For example, young people who report generally trusting other people are both more likely to support democracy than those who don't, (81% vs 69%) but also more like to support strongman leaders (72% vs 51%). In fact a higher proportion of young people who say democracy is a good way to run the country also support the authoritarian methods of rule than those who don't. Perhaps some people just think that there *isn't* a good way to run a country?\r\n\r\nThe report authors believe that the drivers of general detachment that are leading to this and many other negative effects on young people can be summarised as being the narrowness of their social networks, overprotective parenting, the treadmill of modern work and the online culture.\n",

So most of the levers we can pull at an individual level are about cutting down on the usage of electricity.

				"content_html": "<p>I <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/10/finished-reading-the.html\">recently read</a> <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781250827630\">The Expectation Effect</a>, a fascinating book looking at how what you expect influences what actually happens with regard to your body and life.</p>\n<p>Below is a fairly detailed summary of chapter 6 (prioritised as being most potentially relevant to my work). I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be talking a lot more about the rest of this book in future. But for now, the main topic of this chapter was how your beliefs and expectations influence how your body and brain react to what you eat - potentially useful knowledge for anyone interested in healthy eating.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Our brain&rsquo;s predictive processing means that our <em>expectation</em> of what nutrients a food contains directly affects how our body responds to that food, including our:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>digestion, i.e. the breaking down and absorption of nutrients in the gut.</li>\n<li>metabolism, i.e. how we process the food to power our cells.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we believe we&rsquo;re eating fewer calories than we really are, our body responds to that belief. The brain induces a deprivation mindset, and we feel less satiated, more hungry and inclined to expend less energy in order to preserve fat stores.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s known that appetite is controlled in part by activity in the digestive system - bottom-up information. However the brain also seems to need top-down info e.g. memory and expectation, to make sense of the digestive information input in order to create the appropriate feelings of hunger or satiation.</p>\n<p>Altering how we think about food can change the brain&rsquo;s assessment of what it has eaten.</p>\n<h2 id=\"memory\">Memory</h2>\n<p>A patient who had lost the ability to form new memories, was asked to rate how hungry he was on a scale of 0 -100. He rated his hunger similarly both before and after consuming a meal.  After two meals in a row he felt only partly satiated.</p>\n<p>This suggests that our appetite is not solely governed by &ldquo;fullness signals&rdquo; from the stomach. It&rsquo;s also influenced by our memory of what we ate.</p>\n<p>Milder forgetfulness is also associated with over-eating.</p>\n<p>In an experiment asking students to taste test cookies, they consumed 45% less if they had first been prompted to remember their lunch by noting down what they&rsquo;d eaten.</p>\n<p>Working, watching TV or using the internet whilst eating may create a distraction that impairs our memory of what we ate, leading to eating larger meals and more snacks afterwards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expectation\">Expectation</h2>\n<p>The sense of fullness and satisfaction participants had from eating either 300ml or 500ml of soup was largely based on how much soup they thought they&rsquo;d eaten, rather than how much they actually had.</p>\n<p>Participants who believed they&rsquo;d eaten a 3 egg omelette felt more satiated than those who thought they&rsquo;d eaten a 1 egg omelette, even though they&rsquo;d eaten the same amount.</p>\n<p>Patients who believed that they&rsquo;ve undergone obesity-related surgery, e.g. stomach stapling or gastric balloon, experienced 70% of the benefits of the operation (reduced appetite, higher weightloss) even though the actual surgery never took place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"presentation\">Presentation</h3>\n<p>The presentation of manufactured foods can disrupt our brain&rsquo;s ability to assess its contents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The brain remembers eating a lot less after drinking a small bottled smoothie vs eating the equivalent portions of fruit, giving the expectation of hunger later in the day.</li>\n<li>Several studies show that the exact same food leads to lower satiety when it is labelled &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; as opposed to when it&rsquo;s labelled &ldquo;hearty&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>The more viscous a drink is the more filling we expect it to be, and the higher our physiological response.</li>\n<li>Iron absorption from meals that have been pureed were much lower than the same meal presented in its standard form.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; snacks may be counterproductive - participants given a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; chocolate bar were hungrier afterwards than those given nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"beliefs\">Beliefs</h3>\n<p>When presented with a choice of 2 items such as a McDonald&rsquo;s hamburger and a 8.5oz grilled ocean code, most people think the burger has more calories even though they&rsquo;re about equal, over or underestimating the true value by up to 50%. People who have greater mismatches in their estimates are on average heavier.</p>\n<p>People who agree more strongly with statements such as &ldquo;There is usually a trade-off between healthiness and tastiness&rdquo; tend to have higher BMIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mechanisms\">Mechanisms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin\">Ghrelin</a> is a hormone secreted by the stomach when it&rsquo;s empty.</p>\n<p>High levels induce our body to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lower its metabolic resting rate, burning less energy.</li>\n<li>store body fat.</li>\n<li>feel lethargic, so we don&rsquo;t waste energy on exercise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Participants who had drank a milkshake marketed as indulgent saw lower ghrelin levels, as expected after a meal.

An analysis of 26 American chain restaurants that offer &ldquo;healthy eating&rdquo; options saw that they were less likely to have descriptions relating to enjoyment, vice, decadence, texture and taste.

There are many potential explanations. One study showed that when people are primed to feel poorer and less secure they tend to choose sweeter snacks and have bigger portion sizes, corresponding to observable changes in the body and brain.

				"content_text": "The Conservative leadership contest is progressing with all the charm and grace you would imagine. Intra-party leaks and briefings about rival candidates, lots of truly ludicrous tax cut promises and a bit of culture war here and there. \r\n\r\nThere's just so many of them - eleven candidates at one point before Chishti, Javid and Shapps withdrew. And despite the fact that everyone has an opinion, it's not clear that we actually know who they even are.\r\n\r\n[A poll](https://twitter.com/ChrisHopkins92/status/1547234440497209344) from [Savanta ComRes](https://comresglobal.com/)  asked people to name the candidates based on their official photo.  \r\n\r\nLooking at the more realistic-to-have-a-chance few, about two-thirds of people could identify Rishi Sunak, a third could identify Liz Truss and just 11% managed Penny Mordaunt. \r\n\r\nIf you look only at Conservative voters, the numbers don't exactly sky-rocket - 77%, 45% and 16% respectively.  [Two people](https://twitter.com/ChrisHopkins92/status/1547240171216769025) thought Mordaunt was the global soul-pop sensation [Adele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/5a9ce4595c.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"326\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nIn a way this doesn't yet matter.

When you scan the barcode in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-mail/id1435168829/\">their app</a> you, somewhat inexplicably, get shown <a href=\"https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcode-stamps/videos\">a video of Shaun the Sheep</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/c0d7c53f23.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"272\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>(For reference, the perforation between the Queen&rsquo;s head and the barcode is fake, so you can&rsquo;t easily tear them off.)</p>\n<p>This will invalidate the majority of stamps you might already own - the standard stamps that are just the Queen&rsquo;s head won&rsquo;t be valid after January 2023, although you can apply to swap the current ones for new ones if you like.

It&rsquo;ll also apparently prevent people washing off the postmark ink from stamps and re-selling them for a second use on the black market. I guess that means that barcodes will be tracked and the stamps rejected if used more than once.</p>\n<p>I had no idea that re-using stamps was an avenue of fraudulence so prevalent that it costs Royal Mail tens of millions of pounds a year, but apparently so.

				"content_text": "Earlier this year [Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com/) released a bunch of [stamps](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcoded-stamps), wherein the queen's face is accompanied by a weird looking barcode. When you scan the barcode in [their app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-mail/id1435168829/) you, somewhat inexplicably, get shown [a video of Shaun the Sheep](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcode-stamps/videos).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/c0d7c53f23.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"272\" alt=\"\" />\n\n(For reference, the perforation between the Queen's head and the barcode is fake, so you can't easily tear them off.)\n\nThis will invalidate the majority of stamps you might already own - the standard stamps that are just the Queen's head won't be valid after January 2023, although you can apply to swap the current ones for new ones if you like. But the special edition stamps with nice pictures on will still be OK to use.\n\nWhilst badgering you to download an app to repeatedly watch a short novelty video is clearly massive added value worthy of this radical change alone, apparently that's not the entire goal behind this change. Rather [Royal Mail claims](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset) that the ability to track letters with barcodes will let it monitor and respond to changes in demand. It'll also apparently prevent people washing off the postmark ink from stamps and re-selling them for a second use on the black market. I guess that means that barcodes will be tracked and the stamps rejected if used more than once.\n\nI had no idea that re-using stamps was an avenue of fraudulence so prevalent that it costs Royal Mail tens of millions of pounds a year, but apparently so. Re-using stamps [is already a crime](https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14308/~/what-is-stamp-fraud), for which you can be criminally prosecuted. On the receiver's end, they don't get the letter delivered [unless they're willing to pay ¬£1.50 and collect it](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/royal-mail-crackdown-crooks-cash-12246684). Of course that's only if the crime is detected, but even pre-barcode Royal Mail made efforts in that direction, including apparently [checking whether the stamp has lost its phosphor](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7806207/Couple-washed-700-000-used-stamps-sold-Amazon-eBay-225-000-fraud.html).\n\nThere are seemingly some big operations out there. In 2019 Paul and Samantha Harrison [were convicted of fraud](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7806207/Couple-washed-700-000-used-stamps-sold-Amazon-eBay-225-000-fraud.html) for having washed the postmark ink off 700,000 used stamps and selling the resulting \"usable\" stamps online, meaning Royal Mail lost out on a potential ¬£421,000 of revenue.\n\nAll that aside, stamp traditionalists are [not pleased](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset) with the new design.

Dividing the world into separate sovereign states means that the scale of decision making - a state - does not match the scale of the issues - the planet.</p>\n<p>Solutions to the violence associated with borders would likely include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free movement between states.</li>\n<li>Global rules for working conditions,</li>\n<li>Global rules for environmental protection, and limits on private property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One day, denying equal rights based on birthplace may seem just as wrong as denying civil rights based on skin colour, gender or sexual orientation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"borders-are-not-a-natural-part-of-the-world\">Borders are not a natural part of the world</h2>\n<p>The concepts of states, nations, borders and territories have emerged over the past 5000 years. They&rsquo;re part of a system that attempts to preserve privilege and opportunity for some people by restricting other people&rsquo;s  movement and access to resources.</p>\n<p>In the early days of states, most poor people were unable to move from their immediate locality, being either slaves or serfs. Following the abolishment of slavery in some locations, the poor were often still unable to move as they wish without being criminalised through vagrancy laws, or through being tied to an employer with threats of violence or unpayable debts.</p>\n<p>The development of cartography in the 16th century was a necessary technology to enable the definition of borders. At that point, administering land from a distance became possible.</p>\n<p>The idea that states have defined boundaries, within which they have the exclusive right to administer as they wish, emerged as aristocrats gained control of economic and political authority in place of the Catholic Church. This was formalised via the treaties of Westphalia in 1648.</p>\n<p>For most of the 20th century, borders were mostly just lines on maps. They were only heavily guarded when states were at war with their neighbours. Before World War 1, passports were usually only required in times of war.</p>\n<p>As states began to provide more services like health care, welfare and housing there was concern that non-citizens would take advantage.</p>\n<p>The Law of the Sea turned 44% of the ocean into private property as recently as 1994.</p>\n<p>These days, we live our entire lives in several overlapping bounded spaces, each of which affect our quality of life. For example, where you reside with respect to boundaries such as international borders, county boundaries, council districts, police precincts, school districts, electricity grids, trash collection areas, gated communities and those of private properties may determine your access to education, infrastructure, rights, health care, economic opportunities and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"borders-create-violence\">Borders create violence</h2>\n<p>In 2014, the UNHCR reported 60 million people across the globe were displaced, including 14 million displaced by war.</p>\n<p>Between 2005 and 2014, around 40,000 people died trying to cross a border.</p>\n<p>More than half the deaths at borders in the past decade occur at the boundaries of the EU.</p>\n<p>The attitude that violence at borders is an inevitable consequence when poorer countries border richer ones leads to policies that harden borders. But strengthening borders is a source of violence, not a solution to violence.</p>\n<p>Borders create violence in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly, where migrants are killed by border agents.</li>\n<li>By making border crossing much more difficult and dangerous than it need be.</li>\n<li>By damaging the economic well-being of people.</li>\n<li>By damaging the environment.</li>\n<li>Via the indirect effects of a system that enables each country to prioritise the well-being of its own citizens above the world as a whole.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blaming human traffickers for the adverse situation of migrants absolves states of their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Making the journey difficult has not deterred migrants in the past.</p>\n<p>Countries such as Myanmar and China which have internal movement restrictions are often considered human rights violators. It&rsquo;s inconsistent to think that&rsquo;s true, but yet restrictions on movement between countries are OK.</p>\n<h2 id=\"borders-create-rather-than-reflect-differences\">Borders create, rather than reflect differences</h2>\n<p>State borders create, rather than represent, differences between peoples and places.</p>\n<p>Nations are not the same thing as states.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A nation is a group of people who feel a shared connection to each other and to a land, often such that they feel entitled to have political control over it.</li>\n<li>A state is a political institution with defined borders that has a sovereign right to create and enforce laws over a territory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two are not necessarily contiguous.

				"content_html": "<p>I was recently searching for information as to in which ways coffee might be bad for one&rsquo;s health, even when drunk in moderation. I was considering giving it up if there were thought to be any significant negative health effects I&rsquo;d rather do without.</p>\n<p>One of the most comprehensive-looking papers I chanced upon in my endeavors was <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1816604\">Coffee, Caffeine and Health</a> by van Dam et al in the New England Journal of Medicine.

All credit of course should go to researchers, and all mistakes in summarising are my own.</p>\n<p>It turns out that I did not find anything that suggested much benefit in giving up my up-to-1-cup-a-day of coffee habit. In fact I was somewhat surprised to see that there are thought to be associations between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and positive health outcomes.</p>\n<p>Another couple of links I noted that referred to some of the same data for anyone not in the mood for reading the paper itself are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/\">Coffee | The Nutrition Source | Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html\">Is Coffee Good for You? - The New York Times</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"brief-summary\">Brief summary:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Consumption of up to 3-5 cups of coffee daily is possible as part of a healthy diet, and in fact has been associated with a reduced risk of several diseases. However the evidence as yet doesn&rsquo;t warrant recommending caffeine / coffee intake as a method to prevent disease.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, high caffeine intake can have adverse effects, including exacerabating anxiety. A limit of 400mg of caffeine per day has been recommended for adults who are not pregnant or lactating, and 200mg for those who are pregnant/lactating.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most, but not all, of the beneficial effects seem to be associated with decaffeinated coffee as well as caffeinated, so that is an option if sensitive to caffeine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Caffeine can interfere with sleep, although this varies between people. Nontheless, drinking it late in the day may be unadvisable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unfiltered, and to some extent espresso, coffee have cholesterol-raising compounds so it may be better to limit consumption of those, but filtered or instant coffee does not have that effect.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"in-more-detail\">In more detail:</h2>\n<p>Coffee and tea are amongst the most popular beverages in the world, with their substantial caffeine content making caffeine the most widely used psychoactive agent.</p>\n<p>Caffeine content is typically highest in coffee, energy drinks and caffeine tablets, intermediate in tea and lowest in soft drinks.</p>\n<img src=\"https://adammedcalf.micro.blog/uploads/2022/42fffe7b6e.png\" width=\"421\" height=\"446\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>In the US 85% of adults consume caffeine daily, with an average intake of 135mg a day (~1.5 standard cups of coffee).</p>\n<p>Coffee is the main source of caffeine for adults. For adolescents, soft drinks and tea are their primary sources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"potential-issues-in-research-on-caffeine-and-coffee\">Potential issues in research on caffeine and coffee:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffee contains hundreds of other biologically active phytochemicals. Thus we should be cautious in assuming any effects of coffee are due to the caffeine alone.</li>\n<li>Observing the immediate effects of caffeine may not tell us about long term effects, as tolerance can develop.</li>\n<li>Epidemiological studies of caffeine intake and risk of chronic disease are potentially confounded by smoking or other lifestyle factors. Earlier studies did not account for this bias and produced misleading conclusions. Residual confounding is a risk even for recent studies thatdo adjust for potential confounders.</li>\n<li>Measurement error in assessment of caffeine intake - although self-reports on frequency of coffee consumption are thought to be mostly accurate.</li>\n<li>Most studies use coffee and tea intake as the dominant sources of caffeine. It&rsquo;s not certain that any outcomes would also apply to other sources of caffeine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"metabolising-caffeine\">Metabolising caffeine</h3>\n<p>The half-line of caffeine in human adults is usually between 2.5 and 4.5 hours, but can vary between people a lot.</p>\n<p>The rate of caffeine metabolism is partially inherited.</p>\n<p>Factors that reduce the rate of caffeine metabolism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being a newborn baby</li>\n<li>Taking oral contraceptives</li>\n<li>Being pregnant</li>\n<li>Certain medications, including some quinolone anti-\nbiotics, cardiovascular drugs, bronchodilators,\nand antidepressant agents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Factors that increase the rate of caffeine metabolism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smoking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Caffeine can affect the actions of some drugs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"health-effects-of-caffeine\">Health effects of caffeine</h3>\n<h4 id=\"positive-associations\">Positive associations</h4>\n<p>In moderate doses (40-300mg) caffeine can reduce fatigue and reaction time  and increase alertness as well as  vigilance during long duration tasks with limited stimulation. However it cannot compensate for lower performance after long-term sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p>Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of  cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery diseases, strokes and death from cardiovascular events. There is no increase risk of cardiovascular events in either the general population of people with a history of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>There is strong evidence showing that consumption of coffee and caffeine is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer or an increase rate of death from cancer.</p>\n<p>In fact coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>melanoma</li>\n<li>nonmelanoma skin cancer</li>\n<li>prostate cancer</li>\n<li>breast cancer</li>\n<li>endometrial cancer (similar with caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee)</li>\n<li>hepatocellular carcinoma (stronger with caffeinated coffee)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coffee is associated with liver health, including lower levels of enzymes reflecting liver damage and a lower risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Caffeine metabolites reduce collagen deposits in liver cells. Coffee polyphenols may protect against liver steatosis and fibrogenesis.</p>\n<p>Caffeine may improve energy balance by reducing appetite and increasing the basal metabolic rate and food-induced thermogenesis.</p>\n<p>Increasing caffeine consumption was associated with slightly less long-term weight gain, and there&rsquo;s limited evidence suggesting a small beneficial effect on body fat.</p>\n<p>Caffeine intake reduces insulin sensitivity in the short term. But consumption of 4 - 5 cups of caffeinated coffee every day did not affect insulin resistance. Coffee reduces hepatic insulin resistances, and habitual caffeinated or decaffeinated  coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This suggests the adverse effect of caffeine on insulin sensitivity is either offset by beneficial effects of other coffee components or tolerance is developed to it.</p>\n<p>Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of gallstones and gall-bladder cancer, with a strong association for caffeinated rather than decaffeinated coffee. Both types of coffee are associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones.</p>\n<p>Caffeine intake is strongly associated with a reduction in risk of getting Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and also prevents Parkinson&rsquo;s disease in animal models. This association doesn&rsquo;t exist with decaffeinated coffee.</p>\n<p>Coffee and caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of depression and suicide, although this may not be true for people who consume &gt;= 8 cups of coffee a day.</p>\n<p>Consumption of 2-5 cups of coffee per day is associated with reduced mortality in studies across the world. The effect is similar for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.</p>\n<p>Consuming &gt; 5 cups of coffee was associated with a similar or lower risk of death than no consumption after adjustment for smoking status. Whilst confounding by baseline health status could be an issue, the effect is still seen in studies of participants who don&rsquo;t have chronic diseases or poor self-rated health.</p>\n<h4 id=\"negative-associations\">Negative associations</h4>\n<p>High levels of caffeine intake can induce anxiety, particularly on occasions &gt;200mg are consumed, or &gt;400mg a day, and people who are sensitive to it, including those with anxiety or bipolar diagnoses. Effects can very a lot between people.</p>\n<p>Caffeine consumption late in the day can increase sleep latency and lower quality of sleep. Effects can very a lot between people.</p>\n<p>Very high doses of caffeine are also associated with restlessness, nervousness,  dysphoria, insomnia, excitement, psychomotor agitation, and rambling flow of thought and speech.</p>\n<p>Caffeine can become toxics at intakes of &gt;= 1.2g. It may be fatal at doses of 10-14g. This is equivalent to around 75-100 standard cups of coffee.</p>\n<p>High consumption of energy drinks and shots, particularly if mixed with alcohol, has been linked to adverse cardio-vascular, psychological, and neurologic events,  including fatal events. The reasons may related to consumption patterns, usage among children, lack of clarity about caffeine content and possible additive effects with other ingredients of the drinks. <strong>Recommendation here is to avoid consumption of &gt;200mg caffeine per occasion and not to mix with alcohol.</strong></p>\n<p>Quitting a caffeine habit can lead to withdrawal symptoms, lasting from 2-9 days. Gradually decreasing caffeine consumption can help with these.</p>\n<p>Unfiltered coffee has high concentrations of  the cholesterol-raising compound cafestol, with expresso having intermediate levels and filters or instant coffee having almost none. High consumption of unfiltered coffee increases cholesterol levels in comparison to filtered coffee, which would predict an 11% risk increase of major cardiovascular events. In the same study, filtered coffee did not raise cholesterol levels. <strong>Recommendation is to limit consumption of unfiltered coffee, and moderate consumption of espresso.</strong></p>\n<p>Many caffeinated beverages, such as sugary soft drinks or creamy coffee servings, are high in calories, which could lead to weight gain.</p>\n<p>In pregnancy, higher caffeine intake is associated with lower birth weight -associations have been seen for both coffee and tea. Also with higher risk of pregnancy loss, although less so at lower levels of intake. It may induce uteroplacental vaso-constriction and hypoxia.</p>\n<p>Prepregnancy coffee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.</p>\n<p>Evidence of negative effects of caffeine on fetal health is not conclusive, but <strong>a prudent recommendation might be to limit caffeine consumption to &lt;= 200mg during pregnancy.</strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"no-or-uncertain-associations\">No or uncertain associations</h4>\n<p>High caffeine intake can stimulate urine output. No detrimental effects on hydration have been seen with long-term consumption of moderate doses of caffeine &lt;= 400mg per day.</p>\n<p>Although caffeine is associated with increased blood pressure, no effect on blood pressure is found in trials of caffeinated coffee, even amongst patients with hypertension - possibly due to other components of coffee. Coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk of hypertension.</p>\n<p>No association has been found between caffeine intake and atrial fibrillation.</p>\n<p>Associations with dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease have been inconsistent.</p>\n<p>‚òï</p>\n",

Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/)\r\n- [Is Coffee Good for You? - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html)\r\n\r\n## Brief summary:\r\n\r\n- Consumption of up to 3-5 cups of coffee daily is possible as part of a healthy diet, and in fact has been associated with a reduced risk of several diseases. However the evidence as yet doesn't warrant recommending caffeine / coffee intake as a method to prevent disease.\r\n\r\n- However, high caffeine intake can have adverse effects, including exacerabating anxiety. A limit of 400mg of caffeine per day has been recommended for adults who are not pregnant or lactating, and 200mg for those who are pregnant/lactating.\r\n\r\n- Most, but not all, of the beneficial effects seem to be associated with decaffeinated coffee as well as caffeinated, so that is an option if sensitive to caffeine.\r\n\r\n- Caffeine can interfere with sleep, although this varies between people. Nontheless, drinking it late in the day may be unadvisable.\r\n\r\n- Unfiltered, and to some extent espresso, coffee have cholesterol-raising compounds so it may be better to limit consumption of those, but filtered or instant coffee does not have that effect.\r\n\r\n## In more detail:\r\n\r\nCoffee and tea are amongst the most popular beverages in the world, with their substantial caffeine content making caffeine the most widely used psychoactive agent.\r\n\r\nCaffeine content is typically highest in coffee, energy drinks and caffeine tablets, intermediate in tea and lowest in soft drinks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://adammedcalf.micro.blog/uploads/2022/42fffe7b6e.png\" width=\"421\" height=\"446\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nIn the US 85% of adults consume caffeine daily, with an average intake of 135mg a day (~1.5 standard cups of coffee). \r\n\r\nCoffee is the main source of caffeine for adults. For adolescents, soft drinks and tea are their primary sources.\r\n\r\n### Potential issues in research on caffeine and coffee:\r\n- Coffee contains hundreds of other biologically active phytochemicals. Thus we should be cautious in assuming any effects of coffee are due to the caffeine alone.\r\n- Observing the immediate effects of caffeine may not tell us about long term effects, as tolerance can develop.\r\n- Epidemiological studies of caffeine intake and risk of chronic disease are potentially confounded by smoking or other lifestyle factors. Earlier studies did not account for this bias and produced misleading conclusions. Residual confounding is a risk even for recent studies thatdo adjust for potential confounders.\r\n- Measurement error in assessment of caffeine intake - although self-reports on frequency of coffee consumption are thought to be mostly accurate.\r\n- Most studies use coffee and tea intake as the dominant sources of caffeine. It's not certain that any outcomes would also apply to other sources of caffeine.\r\n\r\n### Metabolising caffeine\r\n\r\nThe half-line of caffeine in human adults is usually between 2.5 and 4.5 hours, but can vary between people a lot.\r\n\r\nThe rate of caffeine metabolism is partially inherited.\r\n\r\nFactors that reduce the rate of caffeine metabolism:\r\n\r\n- Being a newborn baby\r\n- Taking oral contraceptives\r\n- Being pregnant\r\n- Certain medications, including some quinolone anti-\r\n  biotics, cardiovascular drugs, bronchodilators,\r\n  and antidepressant agents.\r\n\r\nFactors that increase the rate of caffeine metabolism:\r\n\r\n- Smoking\r\n\r\nCaffeine can affect the actions of some drugs.\r\n\r\n### Health effects of caffeine\r\n\r\n#### Positive associations\r\n\r\nIn moderate doses (40-300mg) caffeine can reduce fatigue and reaction time  and increase alertness as well as  vigilance during long duration tasks with limited stimulation. However it cannot compensate for lower performance after long-term sleep deprivation.\r\n\r\nCoffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of  cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery diseases, strokes and death from cardiovascular events. There is no increase risk of cardiovascular events in either the general population of people with a history of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence showing that consumption of coffee and caffeine is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer or an increase rate of death from cancer.\r\n\r\nIn fact coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of:\r\n- melanoma\r\n- nonmelanoma skin cancer\r\n- prostate cancer\r\n- breast cancer\r\n- endometrial cancer (similar with caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee)\r\n- hepatocellular carcinoma (stronger with caffeinated coffee)\r\n\r\nCoffee is associated with liver health, including lower levels of enzymes reflecting liver damage and a lower risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Caffeine metabolites reduce collagen deposits in liver cells. Coffee polyphenols may protect against liver steatosis and fibrogenesis.\r\n\r\nCaffeine may improve energy balance by reducing appetite and increasing the basal metabolic rate and food-induced thermogenesis. \r\n\r\nIncreasing caffeine consumption was associated with slightly less long-term weight gain, and there's limited evidence suggesting a small beneficial effect on body fat. \r\n\r\nCaffeine intake reduces insulin sensitivity in the short term. But consumption of 4 - 5 cups of caffeinated coffee every day did not affect insulin resistance. Coffee reduces hepatic insulin resistances, and habitual caffeinated or decaffeinated  coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This suggests the adverse effect of caffeine on insulin sensitivity is either offset by beneficial effects of other coffee components or tolerance is developed to it.\r\n\r\nCoffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of gallstones and gall-bladder cancer, with a strong association for caffeinated rather than decaffeinated coffee. Both types of coffee are associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones.\r\n\r\nCaffeine intake is strongly associated with a reduction in risk of getting Parkinson's disease, and also prevents Parkinson's disease in animal models. This association doesn't exist with decaffeinated coffee.\r\n\r\nCoffee and caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of depression and suicide, although this may not be true for people who consume >= 8 cups of coffee a day.\r\n\r\nConsumption of 2-5 cups of coffee per day is associated with reduced mortality in studies across the world. The effect is similar for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.\r\n\r\nConsuming > 5 cups of coffee was associated with a similar or lower risk of death than no consumption after adjustment for smoking status. Whilst confounding by baseline health status could be an issue, the effect is still seen in studies of participants who don't have chronic diseases or poor self-rated health.\r\n\r\n#### Negative associations\r\n\r\nHigh levels of caffeine intake can induce anxiety, particularly on occasions >200mg are consumed, or >400mg a day, and people who are sensitive to it, including those with anxiety or bipolar diagnoses. Effects can very a lot between people.\r\n\r\nCaffeine consumption late in the day can increase sleep latency and lower quality of sleep. Effects can very a lot between people.\r\n\r\nVery high doses of caffeine are also associated with restlessness, nervousness,  dysphoria, insomnia, excitement, psychomotor agitation, and rambling flow of thought and speech.\r\n\r\nCaffeine can become toxics at intakes of >= 1.2g. It may be fatal at doses of 10-14g. This is equivalent to around 75-100 standard cups of coffee.\r\n\r\nHigh consumption of energy drinks and shots, particularly if mixed with alcohol, has been linked to adverse cardio-vascular, psychological, and neurologic events,  including fatal events. The reasons may related to consumption patterns, usage among children, lack of clarity about caffeine content and possible additive effects with other ingredients of the drinks. **Recommendation here is to avoid consumption of >200mg caffeine per occasion and not to mix with alcohol.**\r\n\r\nQuitting a caffeine habit can lead to withdrawal symptoms, lasting from 2-9 days. Gradually decreasing caffeine consumption can help with these.\r\n\r\nUnfiltered coffee has high concentrations of  the cholesterol-raising compound cafestol, with expresso having intermediate levels and filters or instant coffee having almost none. High consumption of unfiltered coffee increases cholesterol levels in comparison to filtered coffee, which would predict an 11% risk increase of major cardiovascular events. In the same study, filtered coffee did not raise cholesterol levels. **Recommendation is to limit consumption of unfiltered coffee, and moderate consumption of espresso.**\r\n\r\nMany caffeinated beverages, such as sugary soft drinks or creamy coffee servings, are high in calories, which could lead to weight gain.\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy, higher caffeine intake is associated with lower birth weight -associations have been seen for both coffee and tea. Also with higher risk of pregnancy loss, although less so at lower levels of intake. It may induce uteroplacental vaso-constriction and hypoxia. \r\n\r\nPrepregnancy coffee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. \r\n\r\nEvidence of negative effects of caffeine on fetal health is not conclusive, but **a prudent recommendation might be to limit caffeine consumption to <= 200mg during pregnancy.**\r\n\r\n#### No or uncertain associations\r\n\r\nHigh caffeine intake can stimulate urine output. No detrimental effects on hydration have been seen with long-term consumption of moderate doses of caffeine <= 400mg per day.\r\n\r\nAlthough caffeine is associated with increased blood pressure, no effect on blood pressure is found in trials of caffeinated coffee, even amongst patients with hypertension - possibly due to other components of coffee. Coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk of hypertension.\r\n\r\nNo association has been found between caffeine intake and atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nAssociations with dementia or Alzheimer's disease have been inconsistent.\r\n\r\n‚òï\n",
